      <h2>Why I Created This Group</h2>
      <p>
        I started the <strong>ClimateTech</strong> group on LinkedIn to bring together innovators, investors, researchers, and change-makers working at the intersection of technology and climate mitigation.
      </p>

      <p>
        At some point, I became deeply frustrated by the amount of misinformation circulating online and on social media around climate change. Too many messages were being pushed by obscure groups promoting irrelevant or inefficient solutions‚Äîdistracting from the truly urgent priorities like renewable energy and electrification, which still need broad public and government support.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I decided to use this group as a space to repost and share only what I personally find relevant and impactful for the energy transition and climate mitigation. In many ways, this group became my notebook‚Äîa curated feed of trustworthy, insightful content surfaced through my large, highly specialized LinkedIn network (20K+ connections).
      </p>

      <p>
        One reason I chose a LinkedIn group is because it offers an easy way to store and access all past posts on a topic. Nothing gets lost‚Äîit stays searchable and organized over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since 2020, Climate Tech has emerged as one of the strongest focus areas for entrepreneurs, corporates, VCs, family offices, governments, and NGOs alike.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal of this group is to spark conversations, share insights, and collaborate on climate solutions that actually move the needle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you're building, funding, or simply following the space ‚Äî you're welcome to join us.
