    <h1>About the Photography & Fine Art Prints</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>This gallery showcases the photographic work of Nicolas Payen, a French artist whose passion for light, composition, and emotional stillness has matured over more than 25 years of practice. Each photograph captures a moment of beauty — sometimes vivid, sometimes whispered — carefully framed through a refined and poetic lens.</p>

    <h2>Fine Art Print Editions</h2>
    <p>Each artwork is available in three exclusive formats, with a strict limit on the number of prints produced:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gallery Edition (L)</strong> — large-format (longest side: 50 cm), limited to 5 prints.</li>
      <li><strong>Collector Edition (XL)</strong> — extra-large format (longest side: 110 cm), limited to 3 prints.</li>
      <li><strong>Artist’s Proof</strong> — 2 special edition prints, at the artist’s discretion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All prints are produced using high-end professional equipment on Hahnemühle FineArt Baryta paper, mounted on alu-Dibond, and framed with a white border and art box unless otherwise specified. Every edition includes VAT and shipping within Europe, and is personally reviewed before shipment.</p>

    <h2>Order & Availability</h2>
    <p>Availability is listed on each photo page. Once a print run is sold out, no additional prints will be produced. Each print is numbered and can be requested by email. Please mention the title and desired format when placing an inquiry.</p>

    <h2>About NicoAI</h2>
    <p>NicoAI is a digital assistant trained to answer questions about the photography, print formats, artistic intent, and ordering process. You can ask NicoAI about any piece, its size, edition limits, pricing, or the story behind the shot — and it will respond based on Nicolas Payen’s curated documentation.</p>

    <p>If you're unsure about format, framing, or would like a recommendation based on space or lighting, NicoAI can help you narrow it down — or pass the conversation to Nicolas directly.</p>
