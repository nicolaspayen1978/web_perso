    "title": "HeForShe: She for He",
    "content": "Before digging into the topic of this post, I want to give you a bit of background on my personal situation and so where I am coming from. I am married for 5 years, my wife is a talented HR professional who has built an already impressive career at just 40. We have 1 child and expect a second one before the Year of the Monkey. We both are ambitious and have our own individual career goals. We believe this dual approach makes us better professionals and is vital for the balance of our relationship. We both believe we can accomplish this while maintaining a good and healthy environment to raise our children. We are, in fact, like many modern couples in this world. I believe that our society and any business would be better off (financially and in terms of well-being) if they enforced gender equality.\n\n        He for She\n        It is with great pleasure that I have seen the HeForShe movement gaining momentum in recent months. This movement raises awareness on women’s conditions, the need to ensure fairness between genders, and the role that male managers can play in making long-awaited changes happen. In many sectors of our society, decision power still largely lies in males' hands. As such, the HEs of our world need to gain ownership of this issue in order to take action and provide equal treatment to their female colleagues.\n\n        But for SHEs to seize the opportunities arising from this initiative, the He for She concept needs to be applied as much at home as at work. That means the HE needs to think about how he can share household duties to free up time for his spouse, helping her rise to the challenges put in front of her by her managers. Without this, women will have to choose between an accomplished professional life and a healthy family life. Only by fully embracing the concept of He for She at home AND at work can HEs lead sustainable change.\n\n        These are the values I drive at work and at home. In all my roles, I have tried to attract and give opportunities to the talented women I encountered. I also respect the family time of both my male and female colleagues to ensure a proper work-life balance. At home, too, I have, on two occasions, synchronized my career steps with my wife's career opportunities/choices. I assume a fair share of the household work.\n\n        She for He\n        This is the second stage of the journey, and we will not reach the goal without it. Progress should not push us from one extreme to another. I don't believe the desired outcome of the HeForShe initiative is to promote the househusband concept. I believe we aim for a higher goal—a world where women and men have the same chances and opportunities, are rewarded equally, and are free to choose the intensity they want to give to their careers.\n\n        Some countries are well ahead of others in achieving this goal. During my stay in Sweden and Denmark, I witnessed entire societies working toward gender equality, applying this principle in all aspects of life. I once paid 30 to 40 euros for a haircut because there should be no discrimination between male and female in service pricing. My male colleagues took months off work to share parental leave with their spouses (50%/50%). These countries have high levels of female participation in all sectors of society (education, politics, and business).\n\n        My wife has been a great supporter of my career. She is an excellent coach and always responded positively when I asked for her support during intensive business periods, allowing me to focus entirely on my work. Both of us having careers has allowed us, from time to time, to take breaks to reflect on and rethink life’s priorities. Currently, my wife grants me this opportunity—her professional situation allows me the unique chance to work on personal projects and prepare for a major step in my career. She also takes on a fair share of the household work.\n\n        He4She / She4He\n        Due to the legacy of our societies, the HEs must take ownership and actions to make gender equality a reality in all aspects of their lives. There will always be, by choice, housewives and increasingly, by choice, househusbands. But ultimately, we will see more and more couples able to live fulfilling lives with two careers and a healthy family balance.\n\nImage: [https://nicolaspayen1978.github.io/Articles/01_HeforSheSheforHe/image/HE4SheShe4He.jpeg] — \"HE for She She for He by Nicolas Payen\""

    "title": "Productivity Lessons from Settling Down in the World’s Best Place to Do Business",
    "content": "Singapore came out top in the list of “Best places to do business in” issued by the World Bank in 2014. I moved to Singapore late September this year and as I settled down, I was curious to know how fast I would be able to get started in this country. I come from France (ranked 31st), lived for a few years in Sweden (ranked 11th), and recently Hong Kong (ranked 3rd) and therefore have my own frame of comparison when it comes to living and doing business in different countries (for info, US ranked 7th).\n\n        Settling down\n        From the onset, it went very fast and extremely smoothly in almost all aspects. In 3 weeks, our household was back to full productivity. We found and moved into our new house, our son started school, our nanny moved to Singapore with all the paperwork done. All bank accounts, insurance, and utilities are in place.\n\n        No doubt this is a high productivity environment where transactions are executed in an efficient manner. Most processes are thoroughly designed, documented, communicated, some automated, and generally executed at a fast pace. This high level of productivity can be observed for both governmental and commercial entities. The overall experience is also enhanced by the quality of infrastructure offered by the Singapore government (public transport like buses and MRT, 4G network) but also by companies like Uber, that further ease your commute.\n\n        Nevertheless, I still had to spend a lot of time figuring out what needs to be done, identifying the prerequisites for each item, and to best schedule the interactions with the different entities to avoid idle time and optimize the overall time. I also ended up sharing over and over the same documents (passport, work permit, proof of residence, etc.) with many of the service providers.\n\n        Room for improvement\n        There are still a number of improvements that can be driven by the individual process owners. The most important is better support of mobile platforms; indeed some operations/communication still require working on a desktop computer or even doing some paperwork. Full compatibility of IT tools with mobile devices should be the first priority of process owners or CIOs. Today, 60% of internet traffic is from smartphones and this number will only increase. 10% of US smartphone owners do not have fixed home internet connections and rely exclusively on their mobile devices. Nowadays, most people gain access to the internet for the first time through their handheld devices. Bottom line, most of these processes or workflows should be primarily designed for mobile platforms like iOS and Android to be future-proof.\n\n        Next level of productivity can be achieved only by changing the frame of reference\n        Mobile compatibility would be a good incremental improvement but how can we radically change the productivity level for such a process? Achieving such a leap requires us to look at things differently.\n\n        Instead of each entity improving their individual workflows, we should try to integrate these different steps and entities into a unified application/workflow that would define the typical journey of a new entrant in Singapore.\n\n        Imagine if there were an app that could guide newcomers through the process of settling down. Imagine if this app could synchronize and schedule the different interactions with various governmental agencies or service providers. All documents could be seamlessly shared between the future resident and the different agencies/service providers.\n\n        By integrating all touch points that a new entrant has with different parties into a common App, the complete process of settling down would be simplified and optimized by design. This would improve the newcomer's experience while all actors involved would benefit from increased productivity.\n\n        This integration into a single journey/workflow of different actors (Govt agencies, Corporations, NGOs) is still rare in the digital world despite being part of our daily life in areas such as healthcare, education, and city administration. This cross-organization synchronization is also needed for major life events like giving birth, moving to a new place, signing a first work contract, creating a business, buying a home, getting married, getting divorced, retiring, or dealing with the death of a loved one.\n\n        Why doesn’t it exist today? Why is it difficult to implement? There is a need for digital integrators.\n\n        In my opinion, the biggest barrier to such innovation is the lack of ‘organization’ in animating and leading such developments.\n\n        Who would own such an initiative or App? Who would finance it? This is not easy to define mainly because the productivity gains associated with this new journey are shared among the different actors.\n\n        Nevertheless, in the example above, I believe that it would be ‘Singapore society’ that would benefit the most from an easier and faster integration of the recently acquired workforce (through a positive impact on the GDP).\n\n        Let’s assume that an organization would sponsor and finance such an initiative. We would still need to find a ‘vehicle/container’ (from an organizational point of view) to support inter-organizational working groups, drive digital integration, and manage the portfolio of workflows and Apps resulting from this work. This ‘vehicle’ would act as a digital integrator while creating a collaborative environment for virtual teams that include members from different organizations.\n\n        Most of the time, solving societal issues requires close collaboration between NGOs, government, and the private sector. Countries, Cities, or Corporations that master this new type of integration through shared value creation will certainly gain an edge in our digital world.\n\nImage: [https://nicolaspayen1978.github.io/Articles/03_ProductivityLessonsSingapore/image/SingaporeLion.jpeg] — \"picture of Singapore by Nicolas Payen\""

    "title": "Atmosphere, Atmosphere",
    "content": "For the last couple of months, Singapore has been dealing with the discomfort of the haze. Headaches, suspension of outdoor activities, nausea, irritation, depression, and increased frequency of respiratory disorders are some of the most common consequences of the short but painful haze event. Air pollution is a threat that most of the 21st-century urban population endures daily.  The World Health Organization (WHO)  reported this threat in 2014 (cf. map below). Once again, the developing countries are suffering the most. As a consequence, in cities, people have the daily reflex to look at the  Air Quality Index (AQI)  in the same way as they look at the weather forecast in order to schedule their days. These people have a good awareness of the issue; however, most of the people do not.\n\n        Unfortunately, this is only the beginning.\n\n        In the best scenario, the COP21 will be a success and we will get a commitment from all major nations to work towards a scenario where the global mean temperature will increase by 2 degrees centigrade (vs. 4 degrees with the current trend). Let’s face it, an increase of 2 degrees will mean that the overall quality of air in our cities will decrease even further in the coming years.\n\n        Already in 2012, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)projected that by 2050 , air pollution will be the top environmental cause of mortality worldwide , surpassing dirty water and lack of sanitation.\n\n        As a consequence, in July 2014, the United Nations Environment Assembly made improving air quality a top priority for sustainable development and highlighted the growing concern for urban population.\n\n        More recently, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) officialized a stronger focus on Air Quality; in its 3rd Goal “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages,” in its 11th Goal “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable,” and finally in its 13th Goal “Climate Action,” where the UN calls for adaptive technologies and ways to mitigate the risks associated with a degradation of our atmosphere.\n\n        Air Quality Monitoring Systems\n        Independent and reliable outdoor air quality information is now available (through governmental agencies' websites or independent third-party Apps) and allows us to understand better the environment we live in. Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) is a well-accepted indicator, and there is now a broader monitoring of our atmosphere with CO2 and air hazardous substances concentration measurements. Today the Air Quality Index (AQI) measured in our cities focuses on 6 substances: particulate matter (PM10), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2).\n\n        Indoor Air Quality\n        There is a common agreement that staying indoors and avoiding outdoor activities will protect you from air pollution. For example, my 4-year-old son had to stay inside his school for all his activities for a month due to the haze issue. But while we have more and more access to reliable measurements of outdoor pollution, we are still lacking data about Indoor Air Quality.\n\n        Recently, a new study from the National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS) and Harvard shows that cognitive functions were “significantly better in Green+ building conditions compared to the Conventional building conditions..... These findings have wide-ranging implications because this study was designed to reflect conditions that are commonly encountered every day in many indoor environments.” In this study, maintaining a good Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) is associated with maintaining the right level of CO2 and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and/or with a good outdoor air supply. To put it in a nutshell, the study shows that having the right indoor air quality will boost the productivity and creativity of the occupants (up to 100% gain!).\n\n        Indoor Air Quality vs. Outdoor Air Quality\n        In October, I met with the founder of uHoo (an IoT start-up working on indoor air quality monitoring systems) named Dustin Jefferson Onghanseng. He shared with me the results of an experiment uHoo did during the IoT conference held in Singapore on the 22nd and 23rd of September. uHoo's team measured during 2 days (during the haze issue) the indoor air quality (PM2.5 level) at the venue (building designed in the 90s).\n\n        The results can be seen in the graph below. I added the green curve that shows the outdoor pollution measurement (PSI) provided by the Singaporean National Environment Agency (NEA). Due to the haze, we can assume that it is, in fact, the density of PM2.5 that is measured. The blue curve is the PM2.5 level measured by uHoo (it is the average value of 4 data points measured in the building).\n\n         \n            \n            \n        \n\n        The main takeaway from the graph is that the building does not protect us effectively from air pollution. The indoor air reached the same level of pollution as the outdoor one; the indoor air was unhealthy.\n\n        How come a modern building cannot do a better job at protecting its occupants?\n\n        The data shows clearly that the indoor air quality is poor. There is also a real-time correlation between the outdoor PSI measured for Singapore South on the 22nd and 23rd and the indoor value measured in the building.\n\n        We can assume the following:\n\n        \n            The polluted outdoor air enters and contaminates the building.\n            The building infrastructure (active and passive equipment) does not act as a filter and so does not protect the occupants (it reaches the same level of PSI as outdoor level).\n            The building HVAC system is able to partially improve the indoor air quality, most probably thanks to the filters installed in the HVAC system (the pollution does not build up constantly over time in the building, and the blue curve goes down several times at recurrent time intervals).\n            The building HVAC system is not able to completely protect the occupants of the building (we are still at unhealthy level for PM2.5). The blue curve goes up several times after going down, maybe due to the supply of outdoor air inside the building by the HVAC system.\n        \n\n        Unfortunately, there is not enough data from this experiment alone to get a full understanding of the phenomenon, and it would be interesting to measure:\n\n        \n            How other air quality indicators (CO2, etc.) evolve during the experiment.\n            How fast does the pollution build up in the building once the outdoor air reaches an unhealthy level.\n            How long does it take to get back to healthy level inside the building after the outdoor level resumes to a healthy level.\n            What is the Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) of the filters used in this building.\n            How other buildings would react in a similar situation.\n        \n\n        Today most of the HVAC systems are designed to optimize temperature, humidity, CO2 level, air velocity, and energy consumption. Very rarely is air quality (in a broad sense as with PSI) a factor used for the optimization of the building management system operations. To make it worse, in our case, the assumption used for BMS design and control loop is that an increased supply of outdoor air will improve the indoor air quality of the building.\n\n        Shouldn't there be smarter ways to use the building's assets to better protect the occupants from air pollution?\n\n        How Can We Improve?\n        We are still in the infant stages of awareness and of technology developments. In order to progress faster, we need, again, a collaboration of the private and public sectors. The following actions can help:\n\n        \n            Organize large-scale experiments (longer measuring time, more locations) in order to better understand the correlation between indoor Air Quality, building infrastructures, and outdoor pollution.\n            Promote active monitoring of indoor air quality , especially for buildings that host sensitive populations (healthcare facilities, schools, sports arenas, elderly care centers, etc.). A first good step would be for governmental agencies or solution providers to monitor the air quality in their own buildings and share the data with the public / science community.\n            Fund or support R&D programs to investigate how we could use the building's active and passive equipment, new technological architectures like the Internet of Things (IoT), to improve indoor Air Quality in our buildings.\n            Change recommendations for sensitive groups to promote more conservative behavior in non-monitored buildings during peak air pollution events.\n            Create related working groups with associations focused on \"Green\" buildings (e.g., U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®)) to investigate how to address increased outdoor air pollution in building designs for the coming years.\n        \n\n        For more information on uHoo, please visit and register at uhooair.com.\n\n        Ps: For this post, I chose a picture of sunny Paris, the most beautiful city in the world. My title refers to the dialogue of \"Hotel du Nord\" by Arletty. This scene was shot in 1938 in Paris’s 10th district, close to where the attacks took place on November 13, 2015. Paris is immortal, and terror shall only reinforce our will to build a better place to live in for our children. The COP21 will take place in Paris, and our leaders will have another opportunity to make a difference for them. Social progress shall not be stopped.\n\n        Update on the 27th of January 2016: Singaporean authorities just announced a major program to install air purifiers in all schools. This is very good news for the health of the young ones and a clear sign that authorities take the risk associated with outdoor and indoor air pollution very seriously. A fantastic step to mitigate the risk, but let’s work on root causes!\n\nImage: [https://nicolaspayen1978.github.io/Articles/02_AtmosphereAtmosphere/image/parissky.jpeg] — \"picture of Paris'sky by Nicolas Payen\"\nImage: [https://nicolaspayen1978.github.io/Articles/02_AtmosphereAtmosphere/image/pm2_5.jpeg] — \"pm2.5 measurements made by uHoo\""

    "title": "Industrial IoT: Putting Customer Services at the Core",
    "content": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is described in the industrial world as the 4th industrial revolution. The Industry 4.0 concept originates from a German government initiative launched in 2011. The IoT market is estimated to be worth $1.7 trillion by 2020 (according to IDC) and could have an economic impact of $4 to $11 trillion by 2025 (according to McKinsey). These numbers are staggering but encompass different industries and a long value chain (from sensor/chipset to cloud/mobile applications). According to most market surveys, the industrial sector represents the largest potential market for IoT. This post focuses on this vertical and the transformative impact of IoT on business models.\n\n        Legacy industrial enterprises are like onions\n        To understand the changes, let’s first examine the legacy systems. For years, enterprises have been enhancing business operations by assembling in-house technologies. Over time, software became increasingly strategic and now forms the core of enterprise operations (from shop floors to boardrooms).\n         \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        Most legacy enterprises exhibit the following characteristics:\n        \n            Enterprise data are confined within the company IT network, with field data collected, filtered, computed, and reported through various control & IT systems (PLC, DCS, SCADA, MES, BMS, ERP, CRM, etc.).\n            Knowledge and competencies are maintained locally or in-house to secure operations.\n            The enterprise network acts as the primary security mechanism against external threats.\n            Asset suppliers or service providers lack access to field data, with access to equipment involved in mission-critical operations strictly restricted.\n            Business operations largely revolve around the manufacturing and distribution of goods.\n        \n\n        We saw a significant transformation with the advent of cloud technology in 2006. Cloud technology, particularly BPaaS, SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS models, has driven a major evolution in enterprise software. Most CIOs have integrated cloud-based solutions, and within the next two years, cloud is expected to represent the majority of enterprise software deployments, with a CAGR three times that of on-premises solutions.\n\n        Connectivity, the starting point of the Internet of Things\n        In 2013, there were already 7 billion machines connected to the Internet, a number expected to reach 30 billion by 2020. When discussing IoT, people often refer to the adoption of M2M, cloud, and mobile technology to enhance enterprise operations. IoT enables asset suppliers and authorized third parties to access physical devices on customer premises (e.g., plants, public spaces). Connectivity is achieved using M2M technology (fixed, cellular, cellular IoT, LoRa, Sigfox) with two main goals:\n        \n            Maintain a secure and reliable communication channel between the physical asset and IT applications.\n            Bypass local enterprise IT networks to ease asset deployment and maintenance.\n        \n         \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        Mobile devices and apps have been key drivers of cloud adoption in the industrial sector and will continue to play an important role in IoT adoption by enabling new innovations.\n\n        IoT applications in the industrial sector\n        Industrial IoT applications can be categorized into three asset types:\n        \n            Workforces: Operators, technicians, supervisors, engineers, and managers, whether employees or contractors, all contribute to operations.\n            Machines: Autonomous assets that perform complex tasks based on information from operators and control systems.\n            Sensors and actuators: Assets with basic or no computing power that collect information on the field and pass it to the control system or perform basic actions based on central system requests.\n        \n\n        Often, the first use case for connectivity arises from after-sales operations, which are critical for many industrial companies due to their role in maintaining customer loyalty. Connectivity allows after-sales support teams to address issues such as:\n        \n            Lack of data when a customer reports an incident.\n            Lack of manpower as only a few individuals possess the required skillset for complex issues.\n            High costs and operational disruptions from on-site interventions, especially in remote locations.\n            Need for asset monitoring to analyze issues and identify root causes.\n            Long deployment times for changes or corrective actions requiring on-site presence.\n            Difficult demand forecasting for spare parts due to limited knowledge of the installed base and customer applications.\n        \n        Product teams and sales departments figured out quickly the potential associated with such connectivity. Thanks to the analysis of field data, they are indeed able to gain a deeper understanding of their customer activities and to build product/application knowledge faster than before.\n         \n        \n            \n            \n        \n\n        By connecting products, suppliers can build value-added services that enhance their assets\n         IoT is changing the HARDWARE industry in the same way CLOUD technology changed the SOFTWARE industry. With connectivity, the nature of the customer relationship evolves. The asset supplier enters in a long term and continuous relationship with its customers and by doing so create a more \"customer centric\" organisation.\n            Armed with data and statistics, it becomes possible for the physical asset provider to move towards service-oriented business models with confidence without expose itself to a major financial risk.\n        Here are some examples of such services:\n        \n            Asset tracking, remote monitoring, and control\n            Preventive maintenance, remote diagnostics, reconfiguration, and updates\n            Enhanced HMI with mobile apps\n            Performance analytics and cross-customer analytics\n            Digitization and virtualization of physical assets\n        \n        These added value services, often primary developed by the after-sales team, are the building blocks that will enable the supplier to automate its service delivery and by doing so create and scale brand new business models.  In this new competition landscape, the players with the largest number of connected devices, the best analytic, and the largest number of customers per asset will enjoy a unique competitive advantage.\n\n        Connectivity enables service-oriented business models\n        IoT is transforming the hardware industry in much the same way cloud technology revolutionized the software industry. With connectivity, customer relationships evolve, enabling suppliers to move toward service-oriented business models confidently. We can outline five steps in this evolution:\n        \n            SELL & FORGET: The supplier provides the asset with only basic after-sales support.\n            SELL & MAINTAIN: The supplier provides maintenance and support services in addition to the asset.\n            SELL/LEASE & CO-OPERATE: The supplier and customer enter a long-term relationship, managing the asset jointly under an agreed SLA.\n            SELL & OPERATE, PRODUCT AS A SERVICE: The supplier commits to the customer’s business outcomes, taking accountability for asset productivity and potential liability.\n            ASSET MUTUALIZATION: With customer consent, asset suppliers can provide additional digital services to third parties, lowering ownership costs for the physical asset.\n        \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n\n        To stay competitive, asset manufacturers must explore how connectivity can enhance their product features and enable new services.\n\n        With IoT, enterprises become more interconnected\n        Maximizing connectivity benefits while scaling IoT business models requires service automation using advanced analytics and AI technologies. APIs facilitate automated data exchange, benefiting both asset suppliers and customers.\n        Modern industrial companies will focus as much on operational technology for managing installed assets and optimizing service delivery as on traditional control layers (PLC, SCADA). A new, parallel data flow will emerge as virtualized assets expose advanced services to authorized Third Party IT systems.\n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        IoT will contribute to build a healthy P&L based on a combination of HW, SW, and Services sales. Integration of data flow and transactions with other asset owners or asset suppliers will become mandatory to survive and scale in this hyperconnected world.\n\n        The race is on!\n        IoT adoption will drive profound changes in product design, asset management, and operational practices. Just as it took nearly a decade for cloud technology to become mainstream, it will take time for IoT to achieve similar traction. \n        Business models like Product as a Service will be key drivers.\n        The next major step in productivity and innovation is underway, and the race is on!\n\nImage: [https://nicolaspayen1978.github.io/Articles/04_IndustrialIoT/image/IoTCore.jpeg] — \"IoTCore by Nicolas Payen\"\nImage: [https://nicolaspayen1978.github.io/Articles/04_IndustrialIoT/image/IoT_onion.jpeg] — \"the IoT Onion by Nicolas Payen\"\nImage: [https://nicolaspayen1978.github.io/Articles/04_IndustrialIoT/image/IoT_Architectures.jpeg] — \"the IoT Architecture by Nicolas Payen\"\nImage: [https://nicolaspayen1978.github.io/Articles/04_IndustrialIoT/image/IoT_M2M.jpeg] — \"the IoT M2M by Nicolas Payen\"\nImage: [https://nicolaspayen1978.github.io/Articles/04_IndustrialIoT/image/IoT_BusinessModels.jpeg] — \"the IoT Business Models by Nicolas Payen\"\nImage: [https://nicolaspayen1978.github.io/Articles/04_IndustrialIoT/image/MergedITEcoSystems.jpeg] — \"the merge of IT systems by Nicolas Payen\""

In the past, companies often focused either on HW products, or SW products, or services delivery. But in order to build IoT solutions, companies need to acquire and assemble an incredible set of talent. In this post, I describe the main competencies required in order to design, industrialize, and operate an IoT solution.\n\n        IoT refers to different architecture typologies. So the set of competencies you need to assemble depends on the architecture(s) you select and the place in the value chain/ecosystem you want to hold. For this list, I considered the most complex situation where you would like to offer a full end-to-end solution (multi-devices to cloud). This is the most challenging from an engineering/operation point of view but it is the most rewarding in terms of value creation.\n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        If you are the founder of an IoT start-up, the engineering head of an MNC, or the HR leader supporting them, then this list of 20 competencies could quickly become your nightmare. So I would recommend first evaluating the competencies that already exist in your organization, the IoT architecture(s) you aim at, the latent value associated with IoT for your business, the expected number of connected devices, your budget, and your timeline. Scoping and selecting your first IoT projects is very important and these should lay a progressive learning path in front of your engineering team.\n\n         If you are starting your IoT journey, then you should be obsessed with the search for the MVP (minimum IoT viable product) in order to manage the risk correctly for your organization.\n\n        This list comes on top of the critical APPLICATION knowledge that would be specific to your industry, to the problem you want to solve, to the application you have in mind for the IoT technology, and to your targeted customers. Building application knowledge in your engineering team should be one of your top priorities. It is indeed the best way to ensure that the creativity of your team is put to the best interests of your customers and so ensure the best practical use of technology.\n\n        Top 5 competencies to build the right IoT solutions\n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            Design Thinking / UI-UX design: Helps you to focus on the customer's job-to-be-done and customer experience, seek for a minimum viable product, and use technology creatively and practically. This is relevant in both industrial and consumer IoT applications. It's essential to involve designers early in the ideation process and give them a strong mandate.\n            System design: An end-to-end IoT solution comprises multiple HW and SW components. Designing a reliable, scalable, and maintainable solution requires understanding how each block will interact or interfere with the others.\n            M2M (telecom, network, device management): The choice of connectivity technology is strategic and depends on various factors. Connectivity is a core part of any IoT solution and includes device management, messaging technologies, SIM card management, authentication, encryption, etc.\n            Cybersecurity: Security principles and mechanisms should be built-in. Hiring security experts to perform security assessments and intrusion tests is recommended.\n            Data protection and privacy legislation: Data protection and privacy legislation vary by country. It is important to comply with these regulations and integrate them into your system design.\n        \n\n        Top 5 competencies to build IoT solutions right\n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            Agile methodology: When the direction is foggy, Agile is the best approach. Agile methodology helps teams respond to unpredictability through iterative work cadences, known as sprints.\n            Design-to-cost: Sixty to seventy percent of a product's cost is committed during concept development. Design-to-cost maximizes ROI for IoT investments.\n            Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA): FMEA is a powerful tool to build-in quality and robustness. Good engineers always think about degraded modes, self-recovery mechanisms, maintainability, and data integrity.\n            Configuration management / Test automation / Continuous integration: Make sure basic quality/development tools are in place to support the SW engineering team.\n            Vendors / suppliers management: Selecting, forming, and managing technology partnerships are crucial in building IoT solutions.\n        \n\n        Top 5 competencies to build IoT devices\n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            Sensing technologies / actuators: Sensing technologies and actuators play a key role in value creation for any IoT solution.\n            Electronic / PCBA / Mechanical design: Smart Things are made of electronics. Customers appreciate high-quality, aesthetically pleasing products.\n            Embedded software: Power consumption requires constant attention from HW and SW developers. ARM, Linux, Java, and OSGI are popular for machines.\n            Wireless: Local connectivity is often required for multi-device systems. Security, antenna design, power consumption, and certifications are typical challenges in implementation.\n            HW industrialization (manufacturing, tooling, supply chain): High product quality distinguishes a proof of concept from a real product/business.\n        \n\n        Top 5 competencies to build IoT services\n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            Cloud architecture / Cloud database: With various cloud strategies available, selecting the right providers and managing them effectively is crucial.\n            Data scientist / Big data processing: A data scientist helps extract maximum value from data, working with the business team to identify new value creation methods.\n            Mobility / Mobile APP: Mobile devices should be a primary area of research to enhance the UX-UI of your solution, especially as customers expect regular updates.\n            API design / management: APIs play a key role in enabling collaboration and enhancing solution market value.\n            IT Service Management (ITSM): IoT solutions often require service-oriented business models. ITIL is widely accepted for ITSM.\n\nImage: [https://nicolaspayen1978.github.io/Articles/05_BuildingIoTteam/image/AllStarTeam.jpeg] — \"An All-Star Team\"\nImage: [https://nicolaspayen1978.github.io/Articles/05_BuildingIoTteam/image/IoT_architectures.jpeg] — \"IoT Architecture\"\nImage: [https://nicolaspayen1978.github.io/Articles/05_BuildingIoTteam/image/BuildTheRightSolution.jpeg] — \"Build the Right IoT Solution\"\nImage: [https://nicolaspayen1978.github.io/Articles/05_BuildingIoTteam/image/BuildItRight.jpeg] — \"Build the IoT Solution Right\"\nImage: [https://nicolaspayen1978.github.io/Articles/05_BuildingIoTteam/image/BuildTheThings.jpeg] — \"Build the Things\"\nImage: [https://nicolaspayen1978.github.io/Articles/05_BuildingIoTteam/image/BuildTheServices.jpeg] — \"Build the Services\""

It is - I believe - an activity that everybody should practice. It only requires curiosity, audacity, and a playful mind.\n\n        \"If you can dream it, you can do it.\" - Walt Disney\n\n        In recent years, creativity has gained more attention and respect in the business world. PWC's 19th Annual Global CEO Survey reports that 51% of CEOs are making significant changes to their organizations to better use digital technologies, ranking this as the most important driver for change according to the 2016 CEO survey.\n\n        Many companies, faced with potential disruptions or opportunities associated with the digital world, have adopted new practices at the core of their strategy and execution. They embrace methods like design thinking or growth hacking, which rely heavily on creativity.\n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        The Future of Jobs and Creativity\n        The World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report confirms this trend. Creativity is set to become the #3 most desired skill by 2020, moving up from #10 in 2015. It will only be topped by critical thinking and the ability to solve complex problems.\n        As a society, we need the private and public sectors to become more efficient innovators and value creators. In the past decade, productivity gains have slowed drastically.\n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        We can hope this plateau of productivity is a precursor to major improvements driven by new digital technologies. Indeed the demography of our societies is going through a massive transformation. By 2050, there will be only 3.5 working-age persons per person aged 65 or over, down from a 7-to-1 ratio in 2015.This demographic shift implies we must double our productivity over the next 35 years, requiring a consistent productivity gain of at least 2% annually.

We need these innovations to bridge the productivity gap.\n\n        \"I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious.\" - Albert Einstein\n\n        At a time when society is calling for innovation and progress, and digital technologies offer more than ever, CREATIVITY remains one of the most crucial things we need.\n\nImage: [https://nicolaspayen1978.github.io/Articles/06_DreamingOutLoud/image/moon.jpeg] — \"picture of the moon by Marc Payen\""

    "title": "From Augmented Reality to Augmented Experience (AR-X)",
    "content": "In this post, we will introduce what we believe will be the next evolution of the AR/VR market: the Augmented Experience (AR-X). AR-X is an emerging mode for augmenting the physical world beyond the current use of flat screens and smart glasses. For example, interactive projections, smart objects, voice, and audio. We will explain that the success of mobile applications like Pokemon Go suggests that AR applications on mobile devices will lead to the mass adoption of the AR-X market (cf. investment plan announced by Mark Zuckerberg).\n\n        Augmented and Virtual Reality: State of the Union\n        2016 was a special year for AR and VR. The combined market grew aggressively, reaching $3.9 billion. The volume of VR units sold was strong but below the ambitions of the major corporations behind it (Facebook, Sony, Samsung, Microsoft). Selling millions of units is not enough for these players, who are looking for numbers in the billions of recurrent users. At the same time, in 2016, thanks to Pokemon Go and its 650 million downloads, AR made an outstanding performance far above expectations. It demonstrated that tablets and smartphones had the potential to drive the mass adoption of AR applications. Mobile APP-based AR presents a set of unique advantages:\n        \n        \n            Removes the entry cost to experience AR. Everyone has a smartphone nowadays.\n            Provides direct access to a massive installed base of potential users.\n            Offers a socially accepted way to consume digital content, as people are accustomed to seeing others with their phones in various settings. There’s no need for users to wear awkward AR devices or isolate themselves from the world with a VR unit.\n        \n\n        This success with Pokemon Go was enough to convince most players (Apple, Facebook, Samsung, and Google) to reinforce their investments in mobile AR.\n\n        From Mobile AR to Augmented Experience (AR-X)\n        AR-X extends the concept of AR by making it more ubiquitous yet less intrusive. Consumers do not need to use their own devices to experience AR-X; even passive customers can be activated by interactive projections or audio.\n        \n            \n            \n        \n        AR-X leverages additional media to augment the world around you, such as animated digital projections, voice-enabled devices, and smart/IoT devices. We believe AR-X technology represents a new way to engage with customers. This form of communication is highly contextual and personalized but effortless for the customer.\n\n        The following video demonstrates a simple implementation of the Augmented Experience (AR-X) concept by creating a brand new interactive interface. This prototype was realized by a US creative agency called argodesign.\n\n        The AR-X concept and this article are the outcomes of research work done by Nicolas Payen (Founder of the Future Economy Studio) and Gregory Cornelius (founder of Protiotype).\n\nImage: [image\\cover.jpeg] — \"From Augmented Reality to Augmented Experience (AR-X)\"\nImage: [image\\AugmentedExperience.jpeg] — \"Augmented Experience (AR-X)\""

    "title": "Discover Why Your Innovation Strategy Needs More Autonomous Teams",
    "content": "Half of the Fortune 500 will not exist in ten years, say c-suite executives. Corporate Venture is at an all-time high. Deep Tech start-ups look with envy at established firms’ assets. In this post, I will explain why corporate facing digital disruption need to enhance their innovation strategy by creating complete autonomous teams working exactly like start-ups. I will also highlight the unique advantages of these autonomous teams / corporate start-up studios in successfully pursuing breakthrough and disruptive innovation as they follow a design and data-driven innovation journey.\n\n        Digital innovation mapping\n        To build an effective innovation strategy, it is important to map the different types of innovation. Abernathy & Clark, Clayton Christensen, Robert E. Johnston, J. Douglas Bate, and Greg Satell made significant contributions to this topic. The most relevant measure of innovation level or intensity is evaluated against each firm’s referential by examining changes introduced in both the technology/application and business model/market dimensions.\n        \n            \n            \n         \n        Becoming Digital often requires companies to make important changes in terms of technology/application and business model/targeted market.\n\n        The Path Dependence theory explains why corporates develop a strong immune system over time, which prevents them from adopting both negative and positive changes. This immune system, embedded in the firm’s DNA, creates a strong roadblock to radical innovations (disruptive and breakthrough ones).\n        \n            \n            \n         \n         The above map defines the overall level of innovation according to the technology and business mapping. Becoming digital requires firms to become more efficient at managing disruptive and breakthrough innovation projects.\n\n        Digital disruption concerns all industries\n        A new wave of digital technologies – often referred to as Deep Tech – is impacting all sectors of the economy. Due to its massive value creation or redistribution impact, it is defined as the 4th industrial revolution by Pr. Klaus Schwab (Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum).\n        \n            \n            \n         \n\n        Deep Tech impacts all industries driving the 4th industrial revolution. Companies need to change drastically to survive.\n\n        Bitcoin emerged as the first digital international currency. Uber and Tesla have higher market valuations than historic car manufacturers. AirBnB competes with Hilton and Marriott in terms of valuation. Amazon is transforming and leading the retail industry, and Netflix is impacting the TV industry as Apple once did with the music industry. These well-known examples of digital disruptions represent only the top of the iceberg, with thousands of new companies planning to leverage Deep Tech to challenge established players and redefine markets.\n\n        Corporates are outsourcing their radical and disruptive innovations to start-ups\n        Although established firms excel at incremental innovation, breakthrough or disruptive innovation projects are rarely successful (too slow, too expensive, not scaling, or not radical enough). Therefore, many corporations – afraid to miss out on the 4th industrial revolution – decided to outsource this work to entrepreneurs. In order to do so, they invested heavily in corporate venture.\n        \n            \n            \n         \n        Corporate venture is now part of the innovation strategy of all major industry leaders\n        In 2016, the most active Corporate Ventures globally were Intel Capital, Google Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, Comcast Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures, Cisco Investments, GE Ventures, and Bloomberg Beta.\n\n        The Corporate Innovation Ecosystem\n        Corporations developed more advanced innovation strategies and created a complete ecosystem to scale radical and disruptive innovation projects effectively. Corporates aim to create synergies between their digital innovation initiatives and their core-business digital transformation.\n        \n            \n            \n         \n        To ensure that the corporate immune system does not prevent new ventures' creation, firms must increase the autonomy of teams working on new digital initiatives. These initiatives must be managed as individual ventures, running like start-ups. This organization model is described by Bain & Company as The Firm of the Future.\n\n        Autonomous Innovation teams are like a start-up\n        Start-ups are obsessed with gaining market traction for their products and services. They continuously seek confirmation that they are on the right path to succeed. Mastering the art of pivoting is crucial for entrepreneurs.\n        \n            \n            \n         \n        Founders understand that in their quest to gain market traction, they must reassess their decisions continually, staying open to change as the market demands. This freedom and pragmatic approach allow start-ups to discover new paths to success in uncharted territories.\n\n        \n            \n            The Stanford Business School’s Startup Garage Innovation Process Graphic above is a teaching tools for Stanford University Graduate School of Business to help students understand the innovation process. This graphic is displayed as a large banner in the classroom to keep the students on track throughout the process\n         \n\n        Deep-tech start-ups need corporations\n        It would be dishonest to paint an overly positive picture of the entrepreneurial world. The success rate of start-ups remains low. 71% of start-ups fail in their first 10 years. It is interesting to see corporations betting their future on Corporate Venture, a system with such a high failure rate.\n        \n            \n            \n         \n        Recently, BCG ran a survey with 400 Deep-Tech start-ups, identifying that market access and technical expertise are crucial for their development, both of which corporations can provide.\n         \n            \n            \n         \n        Deep-Tech start-ups welcome the help of corporate to gain market access and technical expertise. Both are critical items for the development of their digital venture.\n\n        The corporate start-up studio is an optimized solution for digital disruption\n\n        Entrepreneurs and the start-up ecosystem have the right DNA to develop new digital ventures successfully. However, when it comes to Deep Tech, corporations possess unique assets that start-ups need.\n\n        A Corporate Start-up Studio brings together the best of both worlds.\n        \n            \n            \n        \n\n        Future Economy Studio offering\n        The Future Economy Studio is the first start-up studio helping corporations create and manage autonomous innovation teams.\n         \n            \n            Services offered by the Future Economy Studio\n\nImage: [image\\innovation.jpeg] — \"innovation strategy\"\nImage: [image\\innovation_typology.jpeg] — \"innovation topology\"\nImage: [image\\innovation_map.jpeg] — \"innovation topology\"\nImage: [image\\DeepTech.jpeg] — \"Deep Technologies\"\nImage: [image\\CVC.jpeg] — \"Corporate Venture Capital\"\nImage: [image\\innovation_matrix.jpeg] — \"Innovation Strategy Matrix\"\nImage: [image\\autonomous_team.jpeg] — \"Autonomous team\"\nImage: [image\\startup_garage_innovation.jpeg] — \"innovation lab\"\nImage: [image\\innovation_lab.jpeg] — \"innovation lab\"\nImage: [image\\BCG_survey.jpeg] — \"BCG Survey\"\nImage: [image\\Corporate_studio.jpeg] — \"Coporate Start-up Studio\"\nImage: [image\\FES.jpeg] — \"Future Economy Studio offering\""

    "title": "Entrepreneur's Life: Lessons from Building Positive Energy Ltd",
    "content": "It has been a very long time since I took the time to write a personal piece about my thoughts and my professional journey.\n\n        Why this silence? Well… I became an entrepreneur in April 2017 when I created the Future Economy Studio. Since then, my life has been a giant roller coaster and an endless marathon. I have been “head down” and running for almost 3 years now.\n\n        I took many times to reflect on my journey and direction. But only today, I can start to make sense of it. Only now, I understand how it transformed me and what I have been through.\n\n        People say it is HARD to build a company. Elon Musk said as an entrepreneur you have to keep “eating glass” again and again. It is, in fact, much harder than I ever imagined.\n\n        I was never naïve about it. I never thought that success comes overnight. I knew it requires chance, passion, grit, and years to be successful. I tried to prepare myself for this endeavor. During the 15 years of my corporate career, I accumulated skills, competencies, and experiences that – I believed – would be useful as an entrepreneur.\n\n        Was I ready? Absolutely not… But you don’t learn to ride a bike by watching videos or reading books. The only way to learn is to give it a try again, again, and again until you are successful.\n\n        There are so many things that you go through as an entrepreneur that I am not sure where to start. In this post, I want to focus on the emotions associated with my journey. Here are the main words that come to my mind to describe entrepreneurship: self-actualization, insecurity, intensity, loneliness, and fun.\n\n        Self-actualization\n        I can fill my life with purpose. Our company, Positive Energy Ltd, has a bullish mission statement: “Reimagine the energy funding process to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy assets globally.” Today the negative effects of global warming are visible: record high temperatures, air pollution, wildfires, rising sea levels, permafrost disappearance, extreme weather events, massive extinction of flora and fauna. But our societies are still falling short of driving ambitious mitigation actions. This is a fight worth taking.\n\n        Insecurity\n        First, there is personal insecurity. Who are you to want to change an industry? Who are you to want to make a positive impact in this world? Who are you to know what needs to be done? Who are you to lead people in uncharted territory? Regardless of how confident you are about your abilities and decision-making process, an entrepreneur will always face doubts about himself or his choices.\n\n        Then there is the venture’s insecurity. Entrepreneurship is a true exercise of value creation. It is a true test of business abilities: do you create value for your customers? Are you somehow unique? Do you have the right team? Can you replicate this at a larger scale? Are you doing it profitably?\n\n        Positive Energy has been running lean for a very long time, and there have been countless times where we almost ran out of money. This has never reduced our motivation or our drive to move things forward. It is just the nature of a start-up. The scarcity of resources is paramount. Entrepreneurs are used to running at the edge of the cliff.\n\n        Intensity\n        How long and fast can you run? I went on this journey full speed and was never able to slow down. More than the very long daily hours, the intensity comes from the ‘mind-space’ taken by my work. As an entrepreneur, you have to make thousands of decisions, many of which have a tremendous impact on your journey.\n\n        The intellectual intensity is extreme. I have never thought so hard on issues and topics. I don’t mind the hardship. As an engineer, I love solving complex issues. But I found it challenging to put my mind at rest or to keep it open for other aspects of my life. Work-life balance is foreign; work-life integration is the only option, but maintaining “life” is the real challenge. My wife is my lifeline. She keeps me grounded and ensures our family still has the right place in the journey.\n\n        Loneliness\n        This is the one I expected the least. Since I started, I have always worked in teams with many different people, and I have met some amazing people along the way. Nevertheless, I have often felt very lonely. The Founder’s price? I think so. When you carry your vision, your project, a team, a company for months or years, always in the hardest times, you are left alone to face the obvious doubts or to make the hardest decisions.\n\n        My wife, my family, my co-founders, and my friends are always there to support me. Over these 3 years, I noticed that the people who are best at supporting and understanding me are also entrepreneurs. There is a special kind of magic when entrepreneurs meet. They share an immediate feeling of belonging and respect. It is maybe one of the most powerful but invisible alumni networks.\n\n        Fun\n        Truly it is. If you enjoy extreme sports, if you are an adrenaline junkie, if you enjoy the highs, the lows, and the unknowns, then entrepreneurship may be for you. There is not one day where I am bored or where I do not enjoy this journey. Sometimes founders are described as the ‘crazy ones,’ the ‘dreamers.’ I like to think that we are ‘Doers.’ We just enjoy doing things, putting our minds to it, and getting it done.\n\n        Now and then, my co-founder and I sit down and reflect on our progress. These are the rare times where we look back at what we achieved instead of looking at the immense quantity of work and challenges facing us. We usually smile and laugh for a few minutes before going back to work.\n\n        There is then an immense feeling of satisfaction. Positive Energy Ltd is now the largest digital platform for renewable energy investments in Asia , with almost half a billion dollars of deals. It is also the first company of this kind in the region. Financing these clean infrastructure projects would help reduce future Asian CO2 emissions considerably.\n\n        During the last 3 years, I have become much better at dealing with the ‘hardship’ of entrepreneurship. I still have much to learn. I will surely face even greater challenges that will test my grit and resilience again. But I feel more capable today than 3 years ago.\n\n         Maybe - as often - it is all about self-confidence.\n\nImage: [image\\ICanDoIt.jpeg] — \"I can / Can't do it\""

    "title": "Three Ways Positive Energy Ltd transforms the energy industry",
    "content": "Positive Energy Ltd - a new way to support clean infrastructure development.\n\n        1. Make the invisible visible\n        Renewable Energy projects tend to be smaller than traditional power generation ones. Many represent an investment smaller than 100 million USD. Consequently, they attract less attention than large, flagship infrastructure projects like coal, gas, LNG, nuclear, dams, or offshore wind.\n\n        Distributed projects are critical in the electrification of our societies. They provide clean power close to consumption points, enable communities to access energy, and allow commercial and industrial companies to reduce their energy costs, carbon intensity, and insecurity. The LCOE of solar projects now competes with new coal, even in emerging markets.\n\n        SMEs developing and operating these renewable energy projects create local jobs. These national champions grow over time as successful energy services companies, propelled by a fast-growing market. The CAGR of RE is 6% globally and higher than 10% in Asia.\n\n        Positive Energy, with its digital platform, makes these smaller infrastructure projects visible to all stakeholders in the energy sector (regulators, NGOs, utilities, IPP, financiers, and service providers). They become an available alternative to traditional carbon-intensive investments.\n\n        2. Connect across borders\n        Oil majors have been growing across borders for decades, creating a strong cross-border ecosystem. To compete effectively, renewable energy players had to grow internationally early in their development.\n\n        Recently, the growing number of RE100 and EV100 signatories—large international corporations—has accelerated this globalization. These companies pledge to use only renewable energy sources for their operations (RE100) or electric vehicles (EV100), driving large energy transition efforts along their supply chains.\n\n        But deploying such programs at scale across various countries isn’t easy. There is growing competition for green/clean energy as local supply remains limited.\n\n        Positive Energy enables internationalization for any renewable energy player. The platform provides a way for local and regional champions to engage with international players. Our community of 1000+ users and 250+ companies forms a foundation for international collaboration around clean power project development, financing, and carbon offsetting programs.\n\n        3. e-Build capacity\n        In many emerging markets, renewable energy penetration remains low, and most countries struggle to increase the share of RE in the energy mix to 20–30%. While developed economies reduce dependence on coal, Asia now represents 80% of global coal demand.\n\n        The main roadblocks to renewable energy development in these countries include inadequate regulatory frameworks, skills gaps, and lack of financing. Capacity development programs funded by institutions like the IEA, ADB, and IRENA help local stakeholders build the necessary skills and competencies.\n\n        Positive Energy plays a key role in helping local SMEs and new investors to build capabilities in this industry. Our platform is user-centric, designed based on feedback from investment analysts, fund managers, and committee members. Our standardized project information sheets, financial models, and virtual data room templates help developers understand investment requirements, organize their ideas, and assist new investors in this market more effectively.\n\n        Through Positive Energy’s platform, preparing an investment file takes only a morning of work yet meets the expectations of large investors. Investors can quickly assess opportunities associated with these projects with just a few clicks.\n\n        We are running out of time. Emissions are not reducing. Global warming is progressing. Economic development remains the main priority, but renewable and energy efficiency programs offer developing countries the chance to build capacities in sustainable industries while improving their citizens' environments. Positive Energy provides a new approach and technology to support sustainable project development effectively.\n\nImage: [image\\OldWays.jpeg] — \"Old Ways do not open new doors\""

    "content": "The Covid-19 crisis forced governments to take radical actions to save the life of millions of people.\n        Governments struggle to solve this issue, but they put all their resources and power in motion to get quick results. Personal freedom and rights have been suspended in order to gain time and save the maximum number of lives. Complete parts of the economy have been shut down, and a tremendous amount of capital has been allocated to this crisis.\n        I feel sad for all people impacted by this crisis: whether losing loved ones, being isolated, feeling depressed and lonely, or dealing with a terrible financial situation (business goes bankrupt, loss of employment, poverty, etc.).\n        I am very impressed by the collective efforts made to solve this problem quickly. Accepting for a limited period negative personal impacts for the greater good of the community is very inspiring.\n        The Covid-19 crisis shows what we can achieve when working together towards a given goal. All countries and governments work together with solidarity to address a threat to our species. Isn't it Mankind at its best?\n        \n        Climate Change is reported in 2021 as the number one risk by the World Economic Forum\n        It even tops the pandemic risk! But it seems difficult for Governments to take radical actions against this 'invisible' threat. Countries are falling short of the commitments they took as part of the Paris Agreement five years ago. Most of them now have very long-term goals (2040 or 2050), and the risk for them not delivering on the CO2 savings we need is still very high. Governments seem to delay important decisions while we are already running out of time.\n        \n        What would it look like if governments were tackling Climate Change with the same urgency and intensity as Covid-19?\n        What if governments around the world would use similar playbooks as the ones created for the pandemic? Let's imagine what the world would look like in a kind of docufiction:\n        \n            \n                Governments would share clear indicators about Climate Change and the problems we face, holding monthly press conferences.

    "title": "Why and How to use Net Present CO2 saving for smarter Climate Action decisions?",
    "content": "Background / Problem Statement\n        Many companies/countries provide long-term targets on GHG reduction or offsets to appear green and sustainable.\n        Many of these companies do not commit or take too little action to change their carbon footprint in the next 5-10 years.\n        These communication strategies can be very confusing and prevent the public and policymakers from understanding the real efforts and progress made on the energy transition and Climate Change mitigation.\n        Each time we delay effective action and postpone GHG emission reduction, we must accelerate further our societies' decarbonization to keep them in line with the Paris Agreement's goals.\n\n        Why a Net Present CO2 Saving Concept?\n        The financial world uses Net Present Value to indicate an investment's current value based on its future cash flows. The discount rate used reflects the opportunity cost associated with this investment. It is also a way to manage the risks/uncertainties associated with cashflows forecasted in the future.\n        A similar concept can be applied to the Carbon flow resulting from green initiatives. In other words, a carbon saving secured in the future won’t be worth as much as one secured in the present.\n        The proposed discount rate is the current yearly targeted emission reduction rate up to 2050 to reach the Paris Agreement. The discount rate shall be revised every year based on the progress we made toward the Paris agreement. If countries don't reduce emissions by at least 7.6% year-on-year, this number will increase in the following years.\n\n        Let's Play with the Concept of Net Present CO2 Savings\n        Let's use Net Present CO2 savings and calculate the current climate value or benefit of a green initiative.\n        In this exercise, we calculate the Net Present CO2 savings in 2021 for 1 \"bullet\" GigaTon of Targeted Carbon emission reduction depending on the year of occurrence. By \"Bullet,\" we mean a one-shot saving that occurs in a single year. Let's say a company says it will reduce its emissions by 1GigaTon in 2050. We consider that the statement applies 1GigaTon reduction in the year 2050.\n        We then calculate the Net Present CO2 saving for this GigaTon saved in 2050.\n\n        Calculation Summary\n        The outcome of the calculation can be summarized as follows:\n        \n            The 2021 Net Present CO2 Saving of 1GigaTon saved in 2050 is 111 MegaTons.\n            The 2021 Net Present CO2 Saving of 1GigaTon saved in 2040 is 231 MegaTons.\n            The 2021 Net Present CO2 Saving of 1GigaTon saved in 2030 is 480 MegaTons.\n        \n        The Net Present CO2 saving we calculate is for an \"equivalent bullet saving\" happening in a single year between now and 2050.\n        \n        Comparison of GHG Emission Reductions Over Time\n        Taking actions to reduce GHG emissions by 1 Ton in 2021 is equivalent to claiming a 8.3 Tons reduction in 2050, 4 Tons in 2040, or 1.93 Tons in 2030.\n        We can also refine the calculation assuming an \"equivalent perpetual saving\"—i.e., a saving that occurs every year from a given year until 2050.\n        Taking actions to reduce GHG emissions by 1 Ton per year from 2021 is equivalent to claiming an 8.75 Tons per year permanent reduction from 2050, 4.1 Tons per year from 2040, or 1.95 Tons per year from 2030.\n        This demonstrates that big numbers and announcements are not always translating into big ambitions!\n\n        Benefits of Adopting this Metric\n        By adopting Net Present CO2 saving, companies and policymakers can achieve:\n        \n            Better prioritization of climate projects: Resources can be allocated to projects with the highest immediate and impactful CO2 savings.\n            Enhanced transparency: Provides a standardized metric that improves comparability across various climate action initiatives.\n            Long-term value alignment: Aligns financial decision-making with environmental sustainability goals.\n        \n\n        How to Implement Net Present CO2 Saving\n        Implementation involves applying a discount rate to future CO2 reductions. The key steps include:\n        \n            Identify the CO2 saving potentials of each project.\n            Apply the suitable discount rate that reflects the urgency of climate mitigation.\n            Calculate the Net Present CO2 saving by adjusting future CO2 savings to present values.\n        \n\n        When used correctly, this metric aids in strategic decision-making that aligns financial and environmental considerations, fostering a more sustainable approach to project prioritization.\n\n        Immediate Climate Action\n        We need CLIMATE ACTION NOW , and I see clear value in companies and countries putting targets for themselves with a 5 to 10 years horizon. It also shows that to address Climate Change, we need to scale the solutions we have on our hands today and work on alternative and more long-term solutions in parallel.\n        We should not bet on solutions with potential GHG emission reductions scheduled only in 2035 and beyond to address the current CLIMATE EMERGENCY.\n\n        As the world intensifies its efforts to combat climate change, the focus increasingly shifts towards smarter decision-making frameworks. This article introduces the concept of Net Present CO2 saving as a metric that can enhance decision-making for climate action, especially in investment contexts.\n\n\n        Conclusion\n        Net Present CO2 saving offers a pragmatic approach to assessing and prioritizing climate action initiatives. As we seek effective strategies for tackling climate change, implementing metrics that reflect both immediate and long-term impacts is essential for meaningful progress.\n\n        Note: I use  the worksheet NetPresentCO2savingsv1_2.xls for the calculation . It is a work in progress, and I am interested in getting feedback and suggestions on this tool/concept.\n\n        Update: In 2023, PWC calculated the new required yearly GHG emission reduction rate to match the Paris Agreement : 17%. This shall be the new discounting factor to calculate the Net Present Carbon Savings.\n\nImage: [image\\NetPresentSavings.png] — \"Net Present Carbon Savings\""

    "title": "Five Thoughts about Hydrogen",
    "content": "A. \"100% Green Hydrogen\" commitment is mandatory\n        A commitment to 100% Green Hydrogen is essential for hydrogen to be a credible climate change solution. Unfortunately, no major players have made this commitment publicly. Only Green Hydrogen makes sense from a climate action perspective, yet oil and gas companies lobbying for hydrogen infrastructure do not advocate for a 100% Green Hydrogen stance. This suggests that they might view hydrogen as a way to repurpose their existing carbon-intensive operations or garner policymaker support.\n        \n        I hope to see leaders in the hydrogen and oil & gas industries, such as BP, E.ON, Enel, Engie, Exelon Corp, Iberdrola, KEP, Tepco, Total, and Shell, initiate a \"100% Green Hydrogen\" movement by committing to produce, distribute, and sell hydrogen solely from renewable sources as part of their climate pledges.\n\n        B. Grey or Blue Hydrogen can be worse than Coal for Climate\n        Producing hydrogen requires energy, often generated from fossil fuels. This process is inefficient (around 50% today), doubling the carbon intensity of hydrogen relative to its primary energy source. Here’s a breakdown:\n        \n        \n            Electricity from coal: 870 g-CO₂ per kWh\n            Electricity from gas: 464 g-CO₂ per kWh\n            Electricity from solar: 41 g-CO₂ per kWh\n            Electricity from wind: 14 g-CO₂ per kWh\n        \n        \n        Generating hydrogen from coal or gas yields even higher carbon footprints than using coal or gas directly, making Black, Grey, or Blue Hydrogen far from climate-friendly. These types of hydrogen are currently more harmful than fossil fuel energy sources.\n\n        C. Green hydrogen should be part of the energy transition\n        Green hydrogen offers unique benefits, such as long-term energy storage and transportability, making it particularly advantageous in areas without renewable infrastructure. Additionally, it allows for a smoother transition by utilizing existing skills and expertise from the oil and gas industries.\n        \n        However, a significant challenge remains: hydrogen requires separate infrastructure, as existing engines and machines cannot use it. Thus, there is still considerable work ahead to make Green Hydrogen economically viable and scalable.\n\n        D. Shipping Hydrogen globally often makes little sense\n        Shipping hydrogen can be as inefficient as printing an email, mailing it, and then scanning it back to digital format. The carbon cost of producing, shipping, and converting hydrogen is far greater than that of direct electricity transmission, which already spans considerable distances globally (up to 2,500 km in countries like Brazil, India, and China).\n\n        E. Hydrogen players without a 100% Green commitment should not receive funding or support\n        The global financial system is increasingly exposed to climate risk, with many institutions holding stranded assets. Financing hydrogen infrastructure without a 100% Green commitment could increase portfolio risks. New hydrogen infrastructure must be aligned with climate goals, backed by clear commitments to keep it as green as possible.\n        \n        A 100% Green Hydrogen commitment would build trust in the hydrogen sector’s role in combating climate change. Without it, doubts about motivations and climate impacts will persist.\n\nImage: [image\\cover.png] — \"Five thoughts about Hydrogen\""

    "content": "What is your carbon footprint? The GHG protocol.\n        There are well-established standards and norms to report your carbon footprint. A commonly used one internationally is the GHG protocol, which classifies GHG emissions into three groups: Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3.\n        \n            \n            Tokyo GHG protocol\n        \n        Scope 3 is the most exhaustive way to calculate and report your carbon footprint.\n        \n            \n            Scope 3\n        \n\n        About Decarbonization / CO2 Savings\n        Regardless of the scope of analysis, few strategies are available to decarbonize and reduce your carbon footprint effectively:\n        \n            Carbon avoidance: Avoiding an activity has a major impact on emissions, though a carbon footprint remains simply by existing. Choices may involve alternative actions with larger or smaller carbon footprints than initially planned.\n            Carbon efficiency: Achieving the same outcome with fewer emissions by modifying methods or choices.\n            Carbon capture: Removing carbon emitted from an industrial process or even directly from the air, with only direct air carbon capture allowing a truly negative carbon footprint.\n        \n         \n            \n            \n        \n        They all behave differently:\n            \n            Carbon Efficiency provides long-lasting impact (do once, benefit forever) . Announcing major CO2 savings in the future does not account for the evolution of the carbon baseline. It claims by design higher numbers than reality unless they are 100% based on carbon capture. Net present CO2 saving is a better way to measure impact. It includes the evolution of the baseline in the calculation.\n            On the opposite, Carbon Capture needs to be provided over time to keep delivering its benefices.\n            Carbon avoidance is the simplest and most impactful.\n        \n        \n            \n            Baseline and carbon savings\n        \n        The covid-19 crisis generates a lot of short-term carbon avoidance. But post-crisis will be a challenge for the Climate.The graph below is a good example of how the baseline related to the power sector may evolve, assuming an aggressive growth of renewable energies in the coming years to come.\n        \n            \n            Carbon intensity of electricity\n        \n        About Carbon Pricing\n        Net-zero commitments should imply that every unavoided CO2 emission is captured. A fair price per tonne of carbon, therefore, aligns with the Linearized Cost of CO2 Capture (LCCC) for Direct Air Capture, estimated between 130 and 340 USD per tonne by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n         \n            \n            Levelised cost of CO2 Capture\n        \n        For example, the Carbon Pricing for countries targeting to offset 50% of emissions would be 50% of direct air carbon capture costs, i.e., between 62.5 USD and 170 USD per tonne. Net-zero, covering 100% of emissions, should use the full LCCC range. Only Sweden and Switzerland have a carbon price close to tge LCCC.\n         \n            \n            Carbon pricing overview in various countries\n        \n        About Carbon Offsets\n        Voluntary carbon market prices are less than 10% of carbon capture costs, tied more to existing savings than new emissions reductions. Projects paid via carbon offsets often lack \"additionality,\" and carbon offsets become more of a financial transfer from emitters to existing carbon-saving projects, with limited impact on global emissions.\n        While new trees absorb carbon after two decades, the total inventory of trees declines, amplifying the urgency of addressing emissions now.\n        \n            \n            Global trees inventory\n        \n        Playing with LCOE and LCCC for Net-zero\n        The power sector, a major carbon emissions contributor, could see the LCOE of carbon-free electricity affected by carbon capture costs. Assuming 250 USD per tonne, coal’s and LNG's competitiveness significantly reduces, making renewables like solar and wind clear cost leaders.\n        \n            \n            carbon-free electricity costs based on LCOE and LCCC\n        \n        If Oil & Gas companies want to remain relevant in climate action, they must invest heavily in scaling direct air capture technologies, encouraged by carbon pricing aligned with direct capture costs.\n\n        Battery storage solutions - not included in this analysis - should have a relatively low carbon footprint compared to the primary energy. They have indeed almost no operational emissions, and they offer a very high level of efficiency.\n\n        Policymakers can make sure the right clean energy / decarbonization investments happened by aligning the Carbon Pricing with the Direct Air Carbon Capture technology cost.\n        \n        Update:The table below shows the prices of Voluntaree Carbon Credits vs. Regulated ones in October 2024. It shows the disconnect between their prices and the costs associated with the negative externalities of the offset emissions\n        \n            \n            Carbon pricing overview in various countries\n\nImage: [image\\CarbonFootprint.png] — \"Carbon Footprint by Nicolas Payen\"\nImage: [image\\GHGprotocol.png] — \"Tokyo GHG protocol\"\nImage: [image\\Scope3GHG.png] — \"Scope 3 of GHG protocol\"\nImage: [image\\decarbonization.png] — \"Decarbonization strategies\"\nImage: [image\\baseline.png] — \"About the baseline when calculation carbon savings\"\nImage: [image\\carbonintensity.png] — \"Carbon Intensity of electricity\"\nImage: [image\\carbonpricing.png] — \"Carbon pricing\"\nImage: [image\\carbonpricingoverview.png] — \"Carbon pricing overview\"\nImage: [image\\treesstock.png] — \"Global Trees inventory evolution\"\nImage: [image\\lcoe.png] — \"LCOE and LCCC combined\"\nImage: [image\\willbefine.png] — \"Compare diffrent carbon prices\""

    "title": "Project Finance vs. Corporate Finance to Invest in Decarbonization and Climate Change Mitigation",
    "content": "1. Why Project Finance vs. Corporate Finance?\n        This article provides the elements to reflect on the type of financing associated with an investment in the renewable energy sector.\n        Positive Energy Ltd decided to focus on project financing and not corporate financing very early in its journey for multiple reasons. This document explains why “Project Financing” is the most suitable way for impact investors to allocate capital to decarbonization initiatives.\n        This paper takes a helicopter view on the topic. It does not go into the differences between the financing of solar, wind, biomass, waste-to-energy, hydropower, energy efficiency, and energy storage projects.\n\n        1.1 Typical developer company structure\n        To protect the development company from bankruptcy, if one of the projects owned or developed by the development company failed, the renewable energy project developers would create one or several asset project companies to hold their assets.\n        The typical structure of a developer is the following:\n        \n            Development company: this legal entity hosts the operations of the developers (salary of employees, marketing, sales, engineering, company IP).\n            Asset project company: this legal entity isolates a project from the development company. The asset project companies are typically Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV).\n        \n        The development company is then a majority or minority shareholder of the asset project companies. The development company can also provide shareholder loans to the asset project companies or owns a specific class of shares to replicate a debt structure.\n        If a developer operates internationally, it will most likely create legal structures that match its scope. This will result in the following structure:\n        \n            Development holding company that owns local development companies in the countries of operations.\n            Asset holding company that owns the different asset project companies located in the countries of the projects.\n        \n        \n         \n        \n            \n            Example of project developer / asset operator company structure\n         \n        \n\n        1.2 How do developers finance projects?\n        If a developer wants to finance the development and construction of a decarbonization infrastructure project, then the development company has different options:\n        \n            Corporate financing: Secure equity or debt financing at the development company level and then finance the development or construction of the project on its balance sheet.\n            Project financing: Secure equity or debt financing at the project company level to finance the project.\n        \n        “Project financing” often refers to the debt financing of infrastructure projects at the Asset Project Company level. It is the most common way used by banks to finance larger infrastructure projects.\n        Corporations can use Green bonds to raise money to finance projects. The development company more often issues green bonds, but the Asset Holding company can also issue them.\n        The typical equity/debt ratio used for Project Finance is much higher than for Corporate finance.In Europe, Solar or Wind project can be up to 90-95% debt-financed. The typical range for the debt-to-equity ratio in a project company is 50% to 95%.\n\n        1.3 Asset company structure typology\n        Large projects will always have their own SPV. This is mandatory to get debt for your project from banks. SPVs are used in all countries.\n        Nevertheless, it is common that investors request a specific investor-friendly and tax-friendly jurisdiction for the SPV used to inject the investment. For example, many projects in South Asia will have both a local and Singaporean SPV.\n        Smaller projects can be aggregated/pooled in a single SPV. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that the projects included in an SPV share the same risk and return profile to make the debt project financing possible and fair. It is common to group small Solar rooftop projects in a single SPV.A developer may also group solar rooftop projects based on some criteria:\n        \n            Off-taker credit risk\n            Off-take agreement type\n        \n\n        2. Project Finance deal vs. Corporate Finance deal\n        This section looks at the differences between corporate finance and a project finance deal.\n        For every project finance transaction or M&A deal, the investor needs to perform the four following things:\n        \n            Identify and evaluate risks\n            Value entreprise and define pricing for the deal\n            Structure the deal and associated collaterals/guarantees\n            Evaluate impacts\n        \n        Depending on the type of financing used, the work will be different. Let’s compare and benchmark corporate vs. project financing.\n\n        2.1 Risks assessment\n        The complexity of assessing risks associated with an investment is higher at the corporate level than at the project level.\n        When investing at the corporate level, it is common for investors to ensure that the development company will use similar contracts and agreements to limit variability in the risk profiles.\n        The scope of the assessment will be different for project financing or corporate financing. Below is a non-exhaustive list of items that comes into the picture for the pricing.\n        \n         \n        \n            \n            risks analysis, project finance vs corporate finance\n         \n        \n        It is possible to standardize and create relatively simple financial models to perform a DCF analysis of a single asset (greenfield or brownfield). Such models make the pricing of the Project Finance deal relatively easy.\n        The complexity of pricing a deal at the corporate level is much higher. Investors often need to use other valuation methodologies based on multiples as advanced financial modeling may be too complex or expansive to achieve.\n        A development company typically has several operational projects and a pipeline of possible projects they want to develop/build in the future. The valuation of this pipeline is also a tricky exercise. The big four audit companies publish some papers on how to value projects inside a portfolio depending on their maturity stage. But it means the buy-side will have to run a due diligence process on all underlying assets under development or built by the development company to price the deal correctly. The development company has most likely built some brand equity and some Intellectual Property (IP) over time. As a result, these intangible assets need to be fairly valued to match the developer’s expectations.\n        Consequently, it can be harder to align on a fair price between a developer and an investor for a corporate finance deal.\n\n        2.2 Pricing\n        The investor needs to price the asset to invest. A lender will also need to perform a financial analysis to size the debt financing effectively and understand the risk profile to define the correct premium.\n        The scope of the assessment will be different for project financing or corporate financing. Below is a non-exhaustive list of items that comes into the picture for the pricing.\n        \n         \n        \n            \n            pricing, project finance vs corporate finance\n         \n        \n\n        It is possible to standardize and create relatively simple financial models to perform a DCF analysis of a single asset (greenfield or brownfield). Such models make the pricing of the Project Finance deal relatively easy.\n        The complexity of pricing a deal at the corporate level is much higher. Investors often need to use other valuation methodologies based on multiples as advanced financial modeling may be too complex or expansive to achieve.A development company typically has several operational projects and a pipeline of possible projects they want to develop/build in the future. The valuation of this pipeline is also a tricky exercise.\n        The big four audit companies publish some papers on how to value projects inside a portfolio depending on their maturity stage. But it means the buy-side will have to run a due diligence process on all underlying assets under development or built by the development company to price the deal correctly. The development company has most likely built some brand equity and some Intellectual Property (IP) over time. As a result, these intangible assets need to be fairly valued to match the developer’s expectations.\n        Consequently, it can be harder to align on a fair price between a developer and an investor for a corporate finance deal.\n\n        2.3 Structuration with collaterals/guarantees\n        Debt project financing is an effective way to invest and secure debt investment. In case of single project default, the most senior lender of this project will be in the best position to recover part of its investment.Other actors and especially the equity ones will end up in a tricky position.\n        \n         \n        \n            \n            structuration, project finance vs corporate finance\n        \n         \n        When a company uses different debt instruments at the Corporate and Project level, it can become very complex to understand which actors get priority in case of default. A detailed analysis of the different shareholder agreements, the loan agreements, and the local regulation will have to be done to understand the situation clearly. The complexity of structuring an equity deal at the corporate level is similar to an equity deal at the project level. Nevertheless, the number of stakeholders involved at the corporate level tends to be higher. This can make the discussion more difficult and reduce the investors’ negotiation power when discussing the deal terms. The development company shareholders may also be more sensitive to dilution at the corporate level than at the project level.\n        Again, the complexity of structuring a deal is much higher at the corporate level than at the project level.\n\n        2.4 Impacts evaluation\n        With the growing concerns about Climate Change, most investors want to measure more effectively the negative and positive impact of their investments to ensure they translate into the positive changes they support.\n        Most advanced investors will measure the returns for their investments not only in financial terms but also for their environmental, social, economic, and governance attributes (ESG).\n        Positive Energy Ltd supports the financing of decarbonization power projects to support climate change mitigation through tangible emissions reduction. In collaboration with the Steward Red Queen (SRQ), Positive Energy Ltd developed a simple ESG assessment framework to help investors assess the impacts of renewable energy project investment opportunities.\n        In the table below, we review the differences in scope between impact assessment at the project and corporate level.\n         \n         \n        \n            \n            impacts analysis, project finance vs corporate finance\n        \n         \n        The evaluation of the impact of the invested funds is simpler and more accurate at the project level than at the corporate level. There is also less overhead included in the financing. Indeed, project finance is an effective way to control the usage of funds. The funds can be made available step-by-step according to the project development and construction progress. By doing so, the impact investors can maximize their impact per capital deployed. They can also be more selective in the types of projects they support.\n\n\n\n        3. Advantage project finance\n        To simplify the execution of the deals and manage their asset portfolio, we recommend that impact investors invest at the project level and not the corporate level.\n        We recommend that investors use similar approach/structuring as a bank when providing debt project financing. But impact investors can bring additional values than banks to the project. For example, investors can be faster in making investment decisions, accept to come earlier into the project lifecycle, support more impactful or innovative projects, be more flexible with the credit assessment of the project sponsor.\n        Equity Corporate Finance deals can offer more securities to the equity investors as all the underlying assets of the development company can be used as collateral. To compensate for this, project equity investors can use – if necessary – warrants (at the corporate level) to ensure that they will be compensated in case of a default event at a single project level.\n        Investing at the project level also allows investors to capitalize fully on the PEL digital platform that simplifies through standardization and automation the project level investment process.\n        Note:This article was initially published on Positive Energy Ltd’s website.

    "title": "Energy Procurement for Decarbonization",
    "content": "The energy transition must accelerate for the world to reach its emissions reduction targets and mitigate climate change. Governments are critical enablers of the energy transition; nevertheless, all organizations can make this transition happen faster.\n        \n        As we are working to electrify our equipment and processes to reduce fossil fuels consumption (80% of worldwide emissions come from fossil fuel), it is essential to ensure that the electricity we consume is as low carbon as possible.\n        \n        This article reviews different electricity energy or power procurement strategies to reduce your carbon footprint and energy costs. Corporations and individuals can apply these strategies to reduce their carbon (GHG) emissions and energy bills.\n        \n        These strategies include quick wins and more advanced ones that require time and effort to implement. Today, in many countries, some electricity suppliers offer a 100% green electricity supply. If you don't use such supplier(s) for your home or your business, that is where you need to start! Shifting to one of these green electricity suppliers is a simple action that drastically reduces your carbon footprint.\n\n        What is Energy procurement?\n        Energy procurement is the process of identifying and selecting the supplier(s) of your energy according to your needs. Along this process, you will investigate and evaluate different options in a value/price analysis.\n        \n        Many different criteria can influence your decisions when you select suppliers and solutions for your energy needs. Below is a non-exhaustive list of these criteria:\n        \n        \n            Characteristic of the items supplied\n            Duration of the contract(s)\n            Pricing structure: fixed vs. variable part\n            Pricing variability over time (exposure to external factors)\n            Security & Quality of supply, Service Level Agreement terms\n            Relationship with supplier\n            Set-up, Termination, and shift cost\n            Capex and cashflow requirements associated with contract(s)\n            The total cost of the contract\n        \n\n        The proposed energy procurement process ensures that effective decarbonization is at the core of the decision and is suitable for all climate-conscious companies. This framework helps you select the right solutions to reduce your carbon intensity and increase your financial savings.\n        \n        Which information do I need before starting the energy procurement process?\n        Before starting the process, it is essential to know well your energy/power requirements. To do so, energy consumers will typically collect the following information:\n        \n        \n            All meters reading for the last 12 months\n            All energy bills for the previous 12 months\n            All current contracts with your energy suppliers\n            Carbon intensity of present energy consumed\n            Identify all future changes in operations that can impact your energy requirements in the future (change in volume of activities, new production line or equipment, energy efficiency program, move to EV fleets, local generation investment, etc…). \n        \n        With this information, you can define at the global and local levels your energy demand curve(s). Energy demand curves will represent the typical consumption of your facilities over a given time. As your energy needs vary from day to day, week to week, and month to month (here), you may have to work with different curves to get a good picture of the situation.\n        The energy demand curves are essential tools. Indeed these curves will be used to evaluate your total energy costs and the total carbon intensity of your consumption. For example, for electricity, both the price and carbon intensity of electricity vary over time. This curve should be pretty granular to have a good analysis. We recommend, if possible, to get 15 minutes interval data for daily curves. But it is not always easy to get granular data for the carbon intensity of the electricity you consume.\n        You may also gather some financial data that will help you in the creation of your plan. Here are some propositions:\n        \n            Capex budget for the next five years\n            Credit rating assessment\n         \n\n\n        What is an effective energy procurement strategy for emissions reduction?\n        We break down the problem into smaller tasks to create effective energy procurement strategies step-by-step. It is easier to address them one by one.\n        Below is an overview of a proposed framework for your energy procurement strategy. It may seem quite extensive, but it is possible to run only a subset of these initiatives.\n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        Some companies have important energy bills and carbon emissions. For them, it is imperative to tackle these issues professionally.  High carbon emissions are a liability for your business. The future will not be kind with carbon polluters.\n        The company’s energy consumption is only responsible for a part of its carbon emissions. Other activities happening along its supply chain will impact its overall carbon emissions. Nevertheless, it is often the easiest part to act upon as a company.\n        Today in most countries, the energy your buy from the grid is carbon-intensive. The utilities rely mainly on gas or coal to produce electricity instead of renewable energy assets. So one of the most effective ways to reduce your carbon footprint is to aim at a 100% clean energy supply for your business. \n        \n        Electrification\n        Replacing equipment that runs on fossil fuels with equipment that consumes electricity is a great way to reduce your emissions while benefiting from a lower total cost of ownership.It is not always possible, but more and more industrial equipment leverages heat pumps or batteries to operate instead of gas or fuel. Companies with fleets may also shift to plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles. \n\n        Energy Efficiency / Energy performance contract(s)\n        An energy efficiency program allows you to reduce your company energy consumption for the same outputs. Energy efficiency projects can take multiple forms (change of equipment, change of processes/operation procedures, change of control system). An Energy performance contract (EPC) allows you to outsource the management and execution of this project(s) to a third party (called an Energy Service Company). This ESCO will typically be remunerated as a percentage of the savings realized by the project(s); this partner may also provide the financing for the project. It can be an attractive solution for a company as it lowers its OPEX without any CAPEX investment. It is also possible to implement a master Energy/Carbon Performance contract (ECPC) with a company that drives the complete Energy Procurement process on your behalf.\n\n        Local power generation\n        You can now produce your electricity on-site by using solar technology, wind turbines, hydro turbines, or waste-to-energy systems.If you own your building or expect to remain at the location for more than 10/15 years, this is most likely a quick win for reducing carbon emissions and energy costs. These projects are relatively easy to implement, and often your bank can finance them. As a consequence, they will quickly translate into lower OPEX for your organization. You can also outsource such a project to a third party (renewable energy developer or an ESCO) that will provide the technical solution and - if required - financing if you sign a power purchase agreement (PPA) or a lease contract. It is common to install an asset with a capacity representing up to 60% of your average power consumption.\n        Nevertheless, it would be best if you tried to increase this number whenever possible. You can align your energy generation curve with your local demand curve or reduce peak power demand by on-site energy storage. You then reduce the amount of energy that you will purchase from third parties or the local utilities. Note that some decarbonization projects are a mix of energy efficiency and local generation. Waste heat recovery systems are popular in continuous process industries and effectively reduce your energy and carbon footprint.\n\n        Power Purchase Agreement\n        If producing all your energy locally is not feasible, you can buy electricity produced remotely with a long-term energy supply contract named Power Purchase Agreement (PPA),  by partnering with a clean energy developer or Independant Power Producer\n        I encourage you to discuss with the potential suppliers how they can align the generation curve associated with the proposed PPA with your demand curve. Indeed, this is the best way to reduce the actual carbon footprint of your operations effectively. It is not always financially viable to do so. Still, in many cases, it is possible to drastically improve the alignment of these curves by using a mix of technologies (solar, wind, storage, others). Recently, some suppliers have started proposing round-the-clock PPA, also called 24/7 PPA or load-following PPA. These contracts ensure that an organization receives 100% low carbon energy according to its instant requirements. Investing in your power generation is an effective way to protect yourself from future energy price increase and keep your costs under control. Most PPA will translate in only OPEX changes for your organization. It is also possible for you to invest your CAPEX in the generation asset(s) to even further lower the cost of the energy produced for you.\n        Power Purchase Agreements come in all forms and sizes. We have seen projects from a few hundred KW peaks to a few hundred MW peaks. I also recommend asking the supplier about the clean energy certificate associated with your power generation projects or PPAs. Please ensure that you are the beneficiary/owner of these certificates when you purchase green energy. If you do not, the asset owner may sell these certificates to another organization to offset virtually their carbon footprint (yes, they can do this! It always feels to me like a double accounting practice).\n\n        Electricity Supply Agreement\n        Based on your updated estimation of your electricity/energy needs, select a supplier that guarantees you a 100% clean energy supply to reduce your carbon footprint.\n\n        Flexibility or Virtual Power Plant agreement\n        You have secured a clean energy supply for your business at this stage of the energy procurement process. But in fact, you can still do more to reduce the overall carbon footprint and energy cost. You can do this by turning your facility into a virtual clean power plant. When there is a very high demand on the electricity network and not enough clean energy supply,  the energy consumed is the most carbon-intensive. It is also the time when power is the most expensive. At peak demand, Utilities use stand-by assets ( gas, coal, or even oil) to provide the electricity required to balance the grid. Your company can help reduce this peak demand by providing flexibility to the grid. You provide this flexibility by voluntarily decreasing your energy consumption for a short time to reduce the instant power demand on the network. It is a common practice for buildings (here) and industrial companies (here). Utilities/Aggregators also offer flexibility programs for residential electrical HVAC systems (here are two examples: with  Nest  or with a  European community-based initiative).  By enrolling in such a Demand/Response program with an aggregator or a utility, you can generate revenues and contribute to the grid’s carbon emissions reduction.\n\n        At this stage of the Energy procurement process, you have evaluated all options to reduce the actual carbon footprint of your facilities and operations. As a company, you can take other actions to reduce further your carbon footprint. You can engage with your partners along your supply chain to reduce their carbon footprint, or you can (re) design your operations, products, and services for them to be more carbon efficient.\n\n        Beyond physical assets and flows\n         There are still two parts of the process that can further reduce the financial costs and risks associated with your energy supply. These instruments are a bit more complicated to put together. Energy consumers mainly use them with an energy bill of at least 10-20 million dollars.\n         Energy finance optimization instruments: Some of your energy supply contract(s) from this energy procurement process may expose you to market volatility. When a local electricity spot market exists, then electricity market prices also fluctuate over time. The variation of the underlying commodities prices or the currency exchange rates may also affect your energy bills. If your energy costs are not fixed by your contract(s), you can put hedging mechanisms to protect yourself from these variations. We recommend you work with professional specialized financial services firms with a good understanding of the commodities market to do so. Most of the hedging facilities have a maximum of 5 years horizon, but some actors can extend it to 10 years. Such an instrument can be interesting if your organization performs a significant investment in energy-intensive equipment with a long payback. Here is a document that details some hedging solutions for the European electricity market.\n        Carbon taxes and reporting optimization instruments: If you have completed all the previous steps of the energy procurement process, you should now have a good understanding of your current and future carbon footprint.  More and more countries have compliance obligations with carbon taxes mechanisms or emissions trading systems (ETS), and more and more companies are reporting voluntary their carbon emissions to the public. For these reasons, your organization may want to optimize further its carbon reporting and the associated carbon tax or costs. You can take two main types of actions to reduce the carbon emissions you report or the financial costs associated without taking concrete decarbonization actions: use carbon offsets and use carbon hedging instruments. Carbon offsetting allows you to buy carbon credits and deduct them from your reported carbon footprint. But purchasing carbon offsets (either on voluntary or compliance markets) does not reduce your actual carbon emissions. When you buy offsets, your company is exposed financially to the price of a ton of carbon. Here again, you can use hedging instruments to protect your company from carbon spot price volatility.\n\n        The outcome of the energy procurement process\n        Once you complete the energy procurement process, you may have to report its outcome to your team and present your strategy.\n        \n        I recommend you gather the following information to do so:\n        \n        \n            Strategy and list of actions\n            Capex plan\n            Opex plan\n            Carbon emissions forecast (actual, for compliance, and reporting)\n            Net Present Value / IRR of the savings actions implemented\n            Net Present Carbon Savings / Yearly Carbon Savings or the activities implemented (for actual emissions)\n            Monitoring plan\n            Contracts and Service Level Agreements\n        \n\n        We hope many of you will share this information with your procurement team and engage them in a decarbonization effort. At Positive Energy Ltd, we help project developers finance renewable energy, energy efficiency, and energy storage projects to support these decarbonization initiatives.\n\n        #procurement #energysupply #RE100 #decarbonization #carbon #carbonoffset #PPA #powerpurchasagreement #electricity #renewablesenergy #procurementstrategy #sustainability\n\nImage: [image\\Cover.png] — \"Energy Procurement for Decarbonization\"\nImage: [image\\FrameworkEnergyProc.png] — \"Framework for Energy Procurement for Decarbonization\""

    "title": "Why are governments considering treating the Fossil Fuel industry like Big Tobacco?",
    "content": "According to the IEA, the world needs to stop investing in Fossil Fuels now to have a chance to limit Global Warming between 1.5 and 2.1 degrees Celsius. Nevertheless, O&G upstream investments are still occurring worldwide, making it almost impossible for our societies to reach their decarbonization goals. None of the large O&G companies have aligned their CAPEX with the Paris agreement. 2021 will be another record year for GHG emissions globally.\n        \n        Fossil fuel companies invest massively to increase their fuel production. But they allocate only a tiny part of their money (less than 20%) in clean energy projects and Carbon Capture and Storage (CSS). It seems the fossil fuel industry has given up on our planet and societies and refuses to reinvent itself, denying the urgency to reduce their volumes and the associated emissions.\n\n        Obviously, decarbonization investments need to outpace fossil fuels investments for emissions to reduce.\n\n        Why are investments in Fossil Fuels still happening?\n        Below are the top 4 reasons why fossil fuel investments are still taking place:\n        \n        \n            There is still a high demand for Fossil Fuels.The overall consumption of fossil fuels has increased continuously in the last years, and so has the world's GHG emissions. \n            \n            \n                \n                \n            \n            Fossil fuel investments provide attractive returns to investors. Fossil fuel companies can offer a higher yield than other companies. Few major producers control the market, and it is relatively easy for them to ensure a minimum level of profitability by regulating the market's supply side. Investors only interested in financial returns and without consideration for the significant damages caused by these companies on the Climate will still invest in the fossil fuel industry in the years to come.\n            The fossil fuel companies don’t see liabilities in being major carbon polluters.Today, fossil fuel companies do not fear justice, lawmakers, and regulators. Consequently, these companies do not believe they can face financial penalties that could put their profitability or existence at risk. In Europe, we recently witnessed an important justice decision (against Shell)  that could positively influence the Oil & Gas (O&G) players' strategy. But it is not enough and still an isolated event, and many (former) state-owned companies remain heavily protected. Even Shell announced that they appealed the decision to keep its high level of investments in carbon-intensive products. While most countries signed the Paris agreement and recently announced Net-zero commitments, governments still have no legal action against Coal or O&G companies to align with their targets. The world will spend billions of dollars on Climate Adaptations programs in the years to come because the governments fail to reduce fossil fuel consumption. These costs will come on top of the already existing massive trillions of dollars in subsidies these fossil fuel companies receive.We should also add charges of the natural catastrophes associated with global warming (wildfires, flooding, storms, etc..). Taxpayers are financing the growth of GHG emissions and the programs to adapt to the associated negative externalities (welcome to the biggest ever created Ponzi scheme!). Today, Fossil fuel and climate adaptations programs represent more investments than those allocated to decarbonization efforts ($500Bln per year).\n            \n                \n                \n            \n            Countries see Fossil fuels as a way to ensure energy security and reduce their energy costs.For years, countries have been building advanced geopolitical strategies to secure their supply of Fossil Fuels at the lowest cost. These energy strategies have been the foundation of their economic and industrial growth. Fossil fuels companies use energy security and energy costs as a dissuasion strategy. The fear of being short of energy or facing increased energy prices encourages countries to postpone necessary climate mitigation actions. But according to the IEA, the current fossil fuel upstream infrastructure is enough to provide the fuel the world needs during the energy transition. Consequently, there is no need to increase the upstream output once the world commits to its decarbonization. Today, due to the cost-effectiveness of renewable energies, countries see clean energy as a way to increase energy independence and reduce their overall energy costs. Indeed, most countries are net importers of fossil fuels and are exposed to commodity market volatility. Declining the import of fossil fuel without losing economic competitiveness is a fantastic opportunity.\n        \n\n        Why may governments want to treat Fossil Fuels like Big Tobacco?\n        The latest reports published by the IPCC give an indisputable scientific foundation for the governments to take action against the fossil fuel industry. But our societies still did not reach Fossil Fuel peak demand. And even with all the current climate pledges, our world is still not on track with the Paris Agreement.\n        Our governments need to think out-of-the-box and challenge the status quo to initiate the decline of fossil fuel consumption. For that purpose, policymakers may decide to treat the fossil fuel industry like the Tobacco one.\n        \n            \n            \n        \n        To influence consumption by being more transparent with consumers about the impacts of fossil fuels\n        Everybody who smokes cigarettes understands they put their life on the line, and nobody wants their children to smoke. By putting similar mechanisms in place for Fossil Fuel products, governments can send a powerful signal to the public and businesses and create a framework to control consumption and ensure its decline in the coming years. Note that people still smoke, there is no shortage of cigarettes, and tobacco companies still exist as profitable private organizations. \n         There will still be fossil fuel suppliers in 2050-2060, and some of our industrial pieces of equipment, planes, and old cars will still run using such energy, but they will become the exception more than the norm.\n\n        To limit the lobbying power from the Fossil Fuel industry\n        Today, fossil fuel companies use all their influence, advertising programs, and lobbying power to defend the status quo and prevent the energy transition from accelerating. They promote unrealistic applications for Hydrogen or the uncertain and unreliable carbon capture and removal technologies.\n        \n            \n            \n        \n        But things are changing; Amsterdam is the first city to ban advertisements for fossil fuels.\n        Such an approach also helps remove Fossil fuel industry representatives from the critical decision bodies related to the energy transition. It indeed becomes much more complicated for politicians to be supported or associated with such companies.\n\n        To degrade the financial profile of the fossil fuel industry\n        It will force fossil fuel players to reconsider their CAPEX. With such a policy in place, the outlook for the future of the fossil fuel industry becomes more uncertain and less attractive for investors. Such actions would put fossil fuel companies in the “sin stocks” category, driving capital away unless they adopt a climate-friendly strategy.\n        It would ensure that private capital and talented human resources privilege the climate-friendly energy sector over the lucrative fossil fuel.\n\n        To finance Climate Action\n        Many people see a global carbon tax (with a fair/high price) as a perfect solution to the climate crisis. Indeed such tax drives actual decarbonization actions across the different industries at different levels of the supply chain.  With a high enough price, these mechanisms drive results (cf. Sweden example). But the implementation of a cross-industry carbon tax can be highly complex (cf. CBAM), and the associated carbon accounting exercises even more. Carbon leakages or creative carbon accounting (with offsets) practices are also difficult to prevent.\n        A Global Carbon Tax on Fossil Fuel Consumption could be a simpler version easier to implement everywhere. The outcome would be similar and highly efficient as the costs would drill down into the economy the same way as the fuels and carbon emissions do. By doing so, carbon-intensive products and services will become less competitive and lose market shares unless they become more carbon efficient.Governments could then control the tax impacts, ensure social justice, and energy transition fairness by applying tax refund mechanisms/exceptions or green energy checks for specific social groups or industries on their budget. Such a Global Carbon Tax on Fossil Fuel Consumption would address the leading root cause of climate change as fossil fuels are responsible for 80% of world carbon emissions. It would also be possible to adjust the level of this tax at the country level according to the cumulative GHG emissions and GDP per capita (PPP) to limit the impact on emerging economies and ensure that historic polluters pay.\n        The acceptance by the public of a Carbon Tax is a risk for policymakers. By treating Fossil Fuel publicly as Tobacco, governments can gain higher support for such measures and create more room for their climate actions.\n\n        This inflection point could also be an opportunity for the Fossil fuel players\n\n        For all these reasons, regulators will radically push for decarbonization and increase the pressure on the fossil fuel industry. For them, dealing with the fossil fuel industry as they deal with the Tobacco one may be part of the solution!\n\n        The fossil fuel industry may fight against such policies. Still, it could also represent a unique window of opportunity for them to negotiate and find a master settlement agreement for the immense legal liability threatening their corporations and their executives.\n\n        As part of this settlement, governments could wave financial and legal penalties of countries/companies that align their CAPEX with the Paris Agreement and support a Global Carbon Tax. Consequently, these corporations and their executives will not fear the legal decisions following the many natural catastrophes and economic disasters Climate Change will generate in the future. The governments' motto for the fossil fuel industry is becoming. \n\n        \"Change now, or you will be forever accountable for your actions!\"\n\n        note: Shell is present in the infographic because it is the biggest brand in the fossil fuel industry as Marlboro is in the Tobacco one.

    "title": "How do I decarbonize my household and make money?",
    "content": "People reading my posts over the months know that climate change and the energy transition is a topic I cherish.\n        I wrote several articles on how corporations can reduce their carbon footprint and put procurement strategies to limit their GHG emissions and energy costs. I also founded a Fintech Climate start-up named Positive Energy Ltd to support the scaling of clean energy infrastructure projects developed by SMEs in emerging and developing countries to accelerate the energy transition.\n        \n        This post exposes the strategy my wife and I put in place to reduce our carbon footprint. Our family (we have two small kids and a golden retriever) relocated in 2020 from Singapore to the Netherlands, and we bought a new home. Along with our installation, we tried to reduce our carbon footprint to contribute to the global effort. I transpose for our household some of the principles I advocate for in my professional life.\n\n        Along with our installation, we tried to reduce our carbon footprint to contribute to the global effort. I transpose for our household some of the principles I advocate for in my professional life. Before starting, I want to give a short overview of our family and values. According to most classification standards, we belong to the lucky ones as we are considered wealthy - even very rich. But we depend mainly on the income/salary of my wife to live our comfortable life. I am not a member of the degrowth movement and believe in the modern economy as a powerful tool to improve people's living standards and happiness over time. I think our economies can achieve economic growth and social development while preserving the climate and biodiversity if well steered by policymakers and enabled by technologies. The strategy to decarbonize our home relies on the following principles: electrification (to phase out fossil fuel), renewables, energy efficiency, and digitalization. \n        \n            \n            \n        \n\n        Energy supply\n        We bought an old home from 1935 of 200sqm. In 2010, our house went through a renovation, and so it has relatively good insulation. The home uses gas for heating, hot sanitary water, and fireplaces. I selected a local green electricity supplier that sources its electricity from a local on-shore wind farm, biomass, and solar.\n        \n            \n            \n        \n        The rest of the time, we rely on the grid and the associated carbon intensity. The Dutch grid is relatively carbon-intensive (441g CO2-eq per KWh) as the penetration of renewable energy is very low today (even lower than Indonesia) and relies mainly on fossil fuels (natural gas). The selection of this green supplier involved no extra costs as the tariffs proposed were competitive. We pay 0.21886 per kWh for a single tariff,  0.22573 € for a normal tariff, and 0.21193 € for an off-peak tariff. For gas, the total supply price per m3 is 0.74071 €. We were lucky to subscribe before the recent energy crisis of this fall and locked our prices for 3 years. If not, our energy costs may be much/much higher. But higher energy costs would increase further the savings we realize on our decarbonization investments.\n\n        Energy Efficiency and lighting\n        Our old house is relatively well isolated (double glazing, wall, and roof insulation). We first upgraded all lights to LED and added a control system to switch them on and off automatically. This upgrade saves us around 540KWh per year, translating to approximately 120 € per year.\n        \n            \n            \n        \n\n        Electrification and Mobility\n        One of the first things we had to do when we relocated was to get a car. We were looking for a low-carbon vehicle able to carry our dog and two kids. We decided to go for a PHEV SUV with a 12KWh battery with a carbon footprint close to 50g CO2-eq per Km. We looked at family-size EVs, but we found them too expensive at the time. There are many options available now on the market. We don't commute in the car for work, and we make most of our trips within a 30km radius. I estimate that we do between 60% to 70% of our Kms using electric engines rather than ICE. We also decided to invest in e-bikes; one is a cargo e-bike that we use for groceries and the kids. We love it, and it allows us to use the car less often. There was an additional cost when buying the PHEV over a traditional ICE car. The Netherlands has put a carbon-based incentive system in place that makes carbon-intensive vehicles less attractive due to taxes. The Netherlands also offers a suitable charging infrastructure.Nevertheless, the penetration rate of Plug-in cars remains low compared to other countries. We love our PHEV car, and we found it highly convenient. When the local wind farm produces electricity, then our PHEV and e-bikes run on clean energy! I estimated that the extra cost when buying our PHEV over the ICE car was 5000€. But we will save more than this on our future fuel costs. We drive roughly 30 Kms on a charge. It means 0,4KWh per km or 0,08 € per Km or 8 Eur per 100km. Today the benzine price in the Netherlands is close to 2 Eur per liter. A similar car with ICE would consume at least 9 L per 100 Km. So it would cost us 18 € per 100Km. We drive 15 000km per year, which means we save 15 000*60%*(18-8)/100=1200 € per year just on fuel. Going to the garage for maintenance or the gas station seems awkward now.\n        \n            \n            \n        \n\n        Local Solar generation\n        We do not want to rely 100% on the low carbon intensity of my energy supplier as the Dutch grid is carbon-intensive, we decided to invest in our solar generation. We installed ten panels on our roof with a peak capacity of 3.9KWp. There is an attractive feed-in tariff (0,27€ per Kwh) in the Netherlands. Still, our primary motivation was to reduce the carbon footprint by reducing our dependence on electricity produced by fossil fuels. So we prefer to consume more electricity and less gas rather than sell electricity with profit to the grid and not reduce our gas consumption. Our solar panels help us provide further decarbonized electricity to our homes, cars, and bikes. We still manage to export from time to time clean electricity to the grid. We spent 5700 € on our solar installation. We decided to use micro-inverters to maximize the output of our system and deal with the shades. The payback is between 5 to 7 years, and the installation's lifetime is at least 20 years. We should produce roughly 3,5 MWh per year. The system is almost enough to cover our yearly electricity needs without the consumption associated with the PHEV/EV car. It means we save on our electricity bill roughly 900 € per year. \n        \n            \n            \n        \n\n        Electrification and Heating\n        Decarbonizing the heating system is often the most challenging part of old houses, but it is also the most significant contributor to our energy bills. I estimate we spend roughly 3000 € per year on gas. 80% of our consumption is for heating alone during winter months. How can you reduce your dependence on gas for heating without doing massive and expensive renovation work? I investigated changing my gas boiler for a central heat pump, but we didn't have the space for the required equipment. Instead, we decided to go for another hybridization strategy and install A/C units in our four bedrooms. I use the A/C units to heat the rooms during winter (as long as the outside temperature is above 5℃). But I can also use them for cooling during the hot summer days. The installation costs were 6600€.\n        \n            \n            \n        \n        We also installed a room-by-room heating control system with intelligent thermostatic valves to ensure that the gas boiler is not running when the heat pumps are on. Such a system by itself can help you save up to 30% on your gas heating costs if you have a central thermostat today but combined with the AC units; the decarbonization impact is even more significant. Consequently, when an A/C is working in a room, the boiler will not heat the room thanks to the local thermostatic valves. Our smart heating system connects to the internet with wifi, and I can easily control it remotely and create a schedule for every room.\n        \n            \n            \n        \n        The control system cost us 1200 €, and my wife's father-in-law upgraded the thermostatic valves (an installation work worth 500 €). The A/C units work during lunchtime at 23℃ and store heat for the rest of the day. The A/C units connect to the internet with wifi. I can easily access them remotely, create a schedule for each room, and make sure they run one after another to limit peak electricity demand. With the solar energy we generate and the wind energy we buy, midday is when we are most likely to have the lowest carbon intensity for the electricity we consume. It is also when the outside temperature is more likely to be above 5℃ and so when we can benefit from the highest efficiency of the A/C unit heat pump (4.13KW of heat for 1 KW consumed).\n        \n            \n            \n        \n        I estimate that by using my AC units for heating during the winter combined with the smart heating control system, I can reduce my gas consumption for heating by 30% to 50% and so save (3000*80%*30% or 50%) between 900 to 1200 € per year mainly during the wintertime. I spend a bit more on electricity when running my four (2.5KW Cooling / 3.3KW heating) AC units. They run 30mn each day during the four winter months, and the impact on my energy bill is (2.5 x 0,5 x 4 x 125 x 0.21886) = 135 € per year. It is also the most impactful decarbonization action of our household.\n        \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n        Financial and Environmental Impact\n        Financial impact\n        In total, we spent a bit more than 19 000 € on decarbonization projects. I also hired five different local companies to help me with these projects. This has a direct impact on the local economy. All of these providers were SMEs. 16% IRR. It is a really good number! At the end, we get almost the same return as a venture capitalist or investment banker while helping reduce global GHG emissions!  This return is also tax-free as it is savings on our various energy bills. The payback is relatively long as it takes 6,5 years to return our investment. We also improved our comfort and increased the value of our home as it became more energy efficient. The AC units will also help us cope with the more frequent hot summer days associated with Climate Change. \n        \n            \n            \n        \n\n        Carbon impacts\n         As a result, our family created a Net Present Carbon Savings (over ten years) of almost 40 Tons of GHG with our investments. After 15 years, these projects will help us to save more than 60 Tons of GHG emissions.The calculation assumes that the dutch electricity's carbon intensity will go from 441 g per KWh to 230g CO2-eq in the coming ten years (minimum requirements according to the Paris Agreement).  But in case the Dutch government would not manage this, our GHG savings would be much more important.\n        \n            \n            \n        \n\n        Lessons Learned\n        Lessons learned for Households\n        \n            Our next car should be an EV. A PHEV with a 100km range and fast-charging capability would ensure that we do 80-90% of our Kms on electricity. I would also consider a PHEV with a 100 Km range on batteries.\n            Increase capacity of our solar installations (either more panels on our roof or by buying from a local community project). These additional solar panels should ideally produce electricity also early in the morning and later in the day. The goal is to have clean regional power available during a longer time of the day. Assuming we drive 20 000Km per year with an EV requiring 20KWh for every 100Km, we would need 4MWh more electricity to cover our yearly electric car consumption. It means we need almost to double our PV installed capacity from 4Kwp to 8KWp.\n            Replace, if possible, our gas boiler with an electric/hybrid boiler and n electric hot water tank. Then we will only use gas for our fireplaces and freezing days. The rest of the time, we would run on clean energy/electricity.\n            Explore local battery energy storage to maximize self-consumption instead of pushing excess solar energy to the grid and reduce grid peak demand. EV-to-home could be a good solution. If our car has a large enough battery, I can allocate up to 20KWh as an energy reserve for our home. It should allow me to better optimize my solar energy usage without investing in an additional battery unit. The mutualization of batteries is one potential advantage I see for an EV over a PHEV.\n            Getting completely rid of gas in our home seems unlikely in the short term. But we will keep phasing it step-by-step. \n            Keep monitoring and improve our decarbonization strategy.\n        \n        \n        Lessons learned for Solution Providers\n        \n            \n                My PHEV car APP does not show enough statistics about the way we use it. For example, I would like to see the ratio between the number of kilometers driven on electric vs. benzine per week, per month, per year. That would help me to understand better our current driving behavior and the associated GHG emissions.\n                I want to get an indication of the carbon intensity of the energy I consume from the grid at a given time. This information would help me further optimize the house's carbon emissions.\n                It would be great if my car charging speed could vary based on my solar generation or the grid clean energy availability. I want my car to charge only when I produce solar energy, when carbon-intensive power plants are not running, and when the grid has the lowest carbon intensity. There is a need for more APIs and algorithms to optimize this. For EV, most people will not use the full range every day. So most of the days, the car could maintain a minimum level of charge (50%) but only charge the remaining if low carbon energy is available.\n                My smart heating system can control the AC units with an IR controller, but it requires another device than the temperature sensor used to manage the heating system. It would be best if this could be the same device and if the smart heating system supports this energy/carbon optimization. \n                I didn't find an excellent solution to shift my main loads (EV and AC units) based on my solar production or the carbon intensity of the grid. It seems there are no such solutions available. There is a need for standards to easily integrate these inputs and outputs in building/home control systems at the software level (Homekit, and co).\n            \n        \n\n        Lessons learned for Policymakers\n        \n            \n                How can policymakers better incentivize households to shift their loads when the electricity is not only less expensive but also less carbon-intensive? Electricity Peak and non-Peak hours Dutch tariffs are not entirely related to carbon emissions.\n                We need more solar power for a longer time of the day.  Hourly based Feed-in tariff encouraging flattened solar generation curves can provide such an intensive and better foundation for decarbonization.\n                Gov. could promote solar community projects for people to easily buy cheap solar power produced locally if their roofs do not provide this opportunity. It is also a way to give access to clean energy to low-income families. People who can install PVs on their roof get a fantastic hedge against future fossil fuel energy price increase and volatility. Utility retailers' prices are linked to fossil fuel prices today and so selecting a green electricity provider may not protect you from the energy price hikes.\n                Why are ICEs still an option? PHEV already provides massive decarbonization in the short term without impacting the grid or the cost of cars too much!\n                A hybridization strategy for gas heating is a good way forward for the existing building installed base. No significant rework is needed, and it is often possible to make such an upgrade. Such upgrades also directly impact the GHG emissions of existing buildings by reducing fossil fuel consumption and helping reduce energy costs. Effective incentives and policies could promote greener energy options, community solar projects, and hybrid heating solutions to aid households in achieving decarbonization goals.\n            \n        \n        \n        Assumptions used for calculation\n            \n                Overall our assumptions are conservative both for the financial analysis and for the carbon emissions calculation.\n                3% inflation on consumer energy bills is low. Most people experience a more difficult situation. Europe also targets now 2% inflation but Energy should be on the high side.\n                3% discount rate is high as most banking products will return much less after taxes.\n                The carbon intensity of the grid is also on the safe side as we assume the Dutch grid will half its carbon intensity in 10 years.\n\nImage: [image\\Cover.png] — \"How I decarbonize my home and make money\"\nImage: [image\\decarbonization_strategy.png] — \"Decarbonization strategy\"\nImage: [image\\energy_supply.png] — \"Local green energy supply\"\nImage: [image\\lighting_calc.png] — \"Saving calculation for LED upgrade\"\nImage: [image\\car_calculation.png] — \"Savings calculation for our PHEV\"\nImage: [image\\solar_calculation.png] — \"Savings calculation for our solar panels\"\nImage: [image\\air_co.png] — \"Now we have air conditioning\"\nImage: [image\\smart_heating.png] — \"Smart heating system\"\nImage: [image\\smart_heating_room.png] — \"Smart heating room view\"\nImage: [image\\calculation_ac.png] — \"Savings for Air Conditioning\"\nImage: [image\\finance_total.png] — \"Total Savings for our family\"\nImage: [image\\NetPresentCarbonSavings.png] — \"Total Net Present Carbon Savings for our family\""

    "title": "A call for clean energy defense bonds",
    "content": "The recent news in the financial press highlights the threat of a recession. This recession would be the consequence of the ongoing efforts of the central banks to limit inflation by increasing interest rates. With more than 8% per year, inflation is at the highest in 40 years.\n\n        The central banks are returning to more rigorous management after printing money extensively during the Covid-19 crisis to support the economy. They aim now to reduce their balance sheet (quantitative tightening) while reducing their debt ratio by maintaining inflation at 2% for the next decade.\n\n        Reducing an all-time-high sovereign debt  seems the right thing to do. We do not want to leave an awful financial situation to the next generations that could jeopardize the financial stability of our nations, and we want to cater to the next crisis.\n\n        But the economy is a living animal and has its dynamic and behavior. It means central banks must react and adjust their plans continuously based on reality and avoid any new significant financial crisis. The skyrocketing inflation may force the hands of the central banks, and their work is more complicated than ever due to the two ongoing crises they have to deal with:\n        \n        \n            Climate change: this crisis requires immediate and decisive actions to phase out fossil fuels and prevent a catastrophic chain of events that could jeopardize thousands of years of global progress and infrastructure development.\n            Ukraine conflict: this war changed the geopolitical situation of the world as well as some of the most critical commodity markets (food and energy). It needs to be dealt with strength but without an escalation to what could be the next global conflict.\n        \n\n        Financial leaders of the world face plenty of catch-22 in these crises. Nevertheless, I believe there is an overlooked option that central banks could leverage in this historical moment.\n\n        The central banks could initiate a \"selective quantitative easing\" policy aligned with the European Climate Bank roadmap while executing their planned quantitative tightening.\n\n        The central banks would then move forward with their monetary policy tightening while creating an exception only for clean energy assets able to mitigate the two current crises. This strategy would support the main goals of our western economies for the following reasons:\n\n        Fight inflation\n        The main driver for the very high inflation is mainly the increased price of energy commodities: coal, gas, and oil. These commodities' prices impact the cost structure of all products and services. Governments want now to reduce their dependency on these energy sources by accelerating the development of clean energy alternatives. Solar and wind energy have become the cheapest power sources in the world. These technologies are highly CAPEX intensive, so their business cases are more sensitive to interest rates than fossil fuels. By offering zero or negative interest rates for these assets, the central bank can ensure enough money remains available to finance these strategic assets and fight inflation by replacing fossil fuels with low-cost, low-carbon electricity.\n\n        Increase Energy Security\n        We pay Russia 600 million euros daily for fossil fuels, and time has shown that Russia has the upper hand in this matter. This outrageous number reflects Europe's past mistakes in developing its energy strategy. This dependency concerns all fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas). Central banks can support the development of locally produced alternative energy sources by maintaining favorable financial conditions to clean energy assets during their quantitative tightening program. Once these clean infrastructures are operational, governments can import fewer fossil fuels and are less dependent on external suppliers. They also reduce their trade deficit.\n\n        Limit Climate Change\n        Phasing out fossil fuels is at the core of climate change mitigation. To keep our societies on track with the Paris Agreements, we need to accelerate drastically (x6) the development of solar, wind, and energy storage solutions (batteries first and later green hydrogen). We also need to accelerate the electrification of our cars/trucks and our buildings' heating/cooling systems. All this requires a considerable amount of capital. Central banks can attract more private equity investors to clean energy asset projects by providing low-cost debt instruments. Private investors will see value in these deals' attractive yields and low risks profile. I believe the following types of loans shall benefit from continuous support from the central banks: debt instruments for project finance of clean energy infrastructure, loans for electric cars and trucks, loans for energy/carbon efficiency projects, loans for heat pumps, loans for solar rooftops, loans for behind the meter energy storage, etc.\n\n        Prepare for a Strong Recovery\n        The handling of the current crises shall not be the birth certificate of our tomorrow's troubles. However, the recent rush for new fossil fuel investments put us on track for two new dangerous developments. On the one hand, we keep depleting our carbon budget at the same unsustainable pace (even faster if we shift from gas to coal or fuel). On the other hand, we are further inflating the bubble of fossil fuel assets. Today, 50% of the global fossil fuel assets are stranded when our societies meet the Paris Agreement. It is potentially a significant financial stability risk for our economies. Indeed, when these fossil fuel companies go bankrupt, we risk a domino effect that could take some major financial institutions down and potentially generate a significant economic crisis again. The alternative solution to the current situation, based on a drastic acceleration of the energy transition, is much more attractive. With a \"selective quantitative easing,\" the central banks support the green jobs and infrastructures we need and reduce our energy costs by fighting inflation at its core. The payback time for these clean energy projects is often between 2 and 6 years. That means our economies could, by 2030, be in a much stronger position than today with an abundance of low-cost clean energy.\n\n        We are at war against climate change, Ukraine is at war against Russia, and we are at war against uncontrolled inflation. Now more than ever, we need a massive call for \"clean energy defense bonds\" supported by the most prominent financial institutions (FED, ECB, World Bank, IEA).\n\nImage: [image\\cover.png] — \"A call for clean energy defense bonds\""

    "title": "Introducing the universal solar tariff",
    "content": "Solar a technology able to protect people from energy poverty\n        During the current energy crisis due to the War in Ukraine, every business and household has to deal with a substantial increase in energy prices. When the governments step in to protect them from skyrocketing fossil fuel prices, they face extraordinary deficits. Exiting this crisis seems extremely difficult.\n\n        The incredible story of solar rooftops\n        The most protected households against energy price volatility are the ones with solar rooftops or Photovoltaic thermal collectors and a high level of electrification. Solar rooftops are a low-cost energy source immune to inflation. Furthermore, the value of these solar rooftops increases as the price of kWh rises.\n        \n            \n            \n        \n        Solar has been, for years, the cheapest way to produce electricity. But it has also other incredible advantages: available in unlimited quantity, has low carbon intensity, and can be produced everywhere on earth. This high-tech source of energy has resulted from exceptional technological developments in the last 45 years. In 1977, the global production capacity of solar modules was only 500KW; in 2022, we will reach a fantastic 500GW or 50 000 000KW.  Its main limitation is obviously that it is available only when the sun shines. \n         \n            \n            \n        \n\n        An innovative concept to address inequality and ease decarbonization\n        It isn't easy to benefit from the advantages of solar technology if you don't have such a PV or PVT system. Indeed solar still has a low penetration in the utility sector, and its benefits are not accessible to all through utility contracts. So people who don't have access to a roof or can't afford a solar installation may end up in a very unfavorable situation and face higher and higher energy bills. It is even more unfortunate that many families live in cities and, therefore, in apartments and rarely have the chance to own a solar system. Outside of cities, lower-income households often live in multi-dwelling units/apartments, so the purchasing power of these families is the most impacted by the electricity price increases. According to the latest forecasts, only 13% of US homes will have a domestic solar PV system by 2030.\n        \n            \n            \n        \n\n        How can we make the benefits of solar technology available to everybody to reduce inequality?\n\n        Community solar and peer-to-peer solar are solutions available today to provide solar to more people, but the \"universal solar tariff\" could have a more significant impact. This concept offers every business and household a \"virtual solar rooftop,\" providing a set amount of kWh at a lower tariff during daytime hours.\n\n        About the Universal solar tariff\n        Today most people have a peak and non-peak tariff based on time of consumption or even dynamic tariffs that reflects the underlying electricity markets. Ev driver will also have to deal with various EV charging tariffs where the price depends on the speed of charging. The four typical levels are: Regular charge (up to 7KW), Fast charge (up to 22KW), Rapid (up to 50KW), or even Super Rapid (<150KW)\n         Typically Peak hours are during the days and non-peak hours are during the night. As solar is only available during the day, it is easy to understand that the low cost of solar energy is not accessible to customers with this tariff structure. A dynamic tariff allows you to benefit partially from the lower price of solar as electricity ends to be cheaper during sun hours due to increased solar generation. Nevertheless, it is still not the most efficient due to how the market prices electricity. The price of electricity on the electricity market is the price of the most expensive generator available at a given time. So you still pay more than a pure solar electricity tariff.\n \n        The \"universal solar tariff\" offers low-cost solar electricity based on a virtual solar rooftop that you lease (subscription).\n        \n            Time of day (from sunrise to sunset),\n            Your location\n        \n\n        A critical aspect of the \"universal solar tariff,\" at least in its infancy, is that it only gives you access to the energy you produce at a given time. It means there is a limit to the quantity of energy you receive based on the weather and the size of your virtual solar plant associated with your contract (subscription). But over time, you may have providers offering unlimited universal solar tariffs (in a similar way as your mobile subscription changed overtime).\n        If you look outside or check the weather, you get a natural feeling about the quantity of electricity available to you through this tariff. The more sun you have, the more electricity you access. As a solar rooftop owner, it is easy to feel how much clean electricity a system produces at a given time based on external conditions. It also means that the solar tariff can not be your only source of electricity; it would be an addition to your current electricity contracts.\n        Now you may be wondering, how does it impact the charging of your EV? Today when you plug your EV, you will either have a regular tariff or a fast charge one. People drive less than 50 km daily, so their car consumes less than 10KWh daily. A vehicle often stands for many hours during the day, so a fast charge is rarely needed to replenish the battery. For example, if you park your car for 6 hours, even if it is a bad day (cloudy and short daytime), you will still get a full charge as long as the solar rooftop can provide you with 1,5KW per h. \n\n        \n            \n            \n        \n\n        People mainly interested in reducing the running costs and GHG emissions associated with their EVs will find that the universal solar tariff is a perfect solution. It is effortless, you plug your EV, select the optimized solar tariff, and the vehicle will receive the maximum available electricity from your virtual solar rooftop. If your schedule requires it, you can still opt for the regular charge to maximize the EV's range.\n\n        At home and on the move, the universal solar tariff allows you to access cheap and clean electricity. \n\n        Below is an overview of how this solar tariff would benchmark compared to other offers.\n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n        Why is the universal solar tariff an exciting concept for utilities?\n        The electricity grid needs continuous maintenance, modernization, and expansion to be able to move electrons between generators and loads. The system also needs additional auxiliary services to guarantee the quality of the electricity provided. All these are the fixed costs of the electricity grid, and every unit (kWh) of the system needs to pay part of this cost.\n        The utilities (distributors and retailers) are, in one way, \"disrupted\" by the solar rooftops because they are selling fewer units over time, reducing their revenues and increasing the remaining units' fixed costs.\n        By providing a universal solar tariff and some \"virtual solar rooftops,\" the utilities protect themselves by selling more units. They can drive electrification further by proposing lower-cost electricity, and they reduce the fixed costs per unit sold.\n        The proposed 'universal solar tariff' is both a defensive and offensive move for utilities. The low price and low carbon intensity of the kWh make it an attractive product for consumers. And the product is designed to limit network costs thanks to the solar optimization that caps the supply based on the actual solar generation (customers get just the number of solar units their virtual roof produced). It means there is no need for additional power generation to balance supply and demand on these contracts. The total electricity consumption is limited to the entire actual generation at a given time. .\n\n        Does the universal solar tariff mean the end of residential solar rooftops?\n        To decarbonize our energy system in time, we need the maximum volume of low-carbon energy as soon as possible. Every time we are able to replace a unit generated by fossil fuel combustion with a clean energy one, we also mitigate the current energy crisis.\n        For this, behind-the-meter solar systems have unique advantages:\n        \n             They require fewer grid upgrades.\n            We can deploy them quickly (no or minor permitting).\n            They are an excellent way to collect private capital for low-carbon assets (as such, they may lower the cost of the overall system).\n        \n        The energy required to power these universal solar tariffs can come from solar rooftops and utility-scale projects. The \"Universal Solar Tariff\" is a great way to mutualize the benefit of solar rooftops.\n\n        How would the tariff impact utilities financially?\n        Financially it plays out well. Solar has one of the lowest Levelized Costs of electricity (LCOE), and the variable costs of solar units are meager compared to carbon-intensive ones. Utilities may have a higher margin rate on the units sold with a universal solar tariff. In countries where solar systems have reached a high penetration level, utilities have created many different tools and incentives to deal with the \"duck curve.\" The duck curve is due to an oversupply of electricity to peak sun hours.\n        \n            \n            \n        \n        There are different strategies to deal with this event: \n        \n            Shift more loads to the time of solar electricity generation\n            Store excess electricity for later use with batteries or green hydrogen\n            Curtail production to maintain balance in the network\n        \n        The universal solar tariff supports the first strategy by encouraging energy consumption at the time of clean electricity generation, thanks to a strong economic incentive.Assuming EVs can provide Vehicle-2-Grid or Vehicle-2-Home services, this concept also supports the second mitigation strategy by storing energy during peak production hours that will be used when the low carbon energy supply reduces.\n\n        What is the difference between traditional green tariff and universal solar tariff?\n        The main difference is that there is a limit to the delivery of electricity as part of this contract when there is not enough sun. Your home or building may fall back on a more expensive tariff once this limit is reached. Another consequence could be that your vehicle may be plugged in but not charging.\n\n        What if I don't consume all the electricity my virtual solar rooftop generates?\n        You will not benefit from these units, and other customers of the universal solar tariff may consume these units. You could imagine providers proposing a universal solar + storage tariff. \n\n        How do you limit the electricity consumption according to the virtual solar rooftop generation in real time?\n        Most electrical systems ensure real-time balancing between the demand and the supply, and utilities supply electricity according to real-time consumption. Utilities use, from time to time, demand-side management solutions to make marginal changes to the demand in case of emergency.\n        To limit the demand according to the generation, we need a new set of actuators that modify the load on the network. Energy management systems can also optimize an installation based on contract (limit peak power, reduce bill). They can help you orchestrate your heat pumps, electrical heaters, air conditioning, water boilers, battery storage, EV chargers, and other equipment according to your universal solar tariffs.\n        Limiting consumption at the load level is also possible if it is connected to a delivery point (a metering device used for billing). Some EVs charger with solar optimization already exists, and they adjust the charge speed based on the rooftop solar electricity generation. Alternatively, your next EV could come as a bundle (car + virtual solar rooftop). For EV load management, the Zappi v2 and Charge HQ are two different examples of technical solutions that support solar optimisation. Below graphs show the impact of such feature on the load curve of a household.\n        Example of EV charging solar optimization (pictures from Toby Roxburgh)\n         \n            \n            \n        \n\n        What about Wind energy?\n        Wing energy is the other significant source of clean and low-cost electricity. As such, it is very suitable for such a tariff. Because wind energy has a less intuitive generation pattern, it can be more difficult for people to intuitively evaluate the amount of electricity generated with their contract at a given time. We can imagine the integration of wind electricity generation in such a tariff by leveraging artificial intelligence to provide a forecast of the energy to be delivered in the coming hours when the user plugs its EV. One advantage of wind is that it would provide an additional source of electricity available during the night.\n\n        What are the main concerns that people will have with the solar tariffs?\n        The main concern will be the cost of existing fossil fuel assets, long-term energy storage solutions, nuclear plants, battery storage, or green hydrogen power plants. Should the costs of these reserved capacities be factored in all units sold, including the ones as part of the universal solar tariff? By doing so, are we preventing optimization between the generation and consumption curve? Or should we factor these costs only to the units concerned to have a lower tariff that people can work with, encourage the shifting of loads to low-carbon time-of-generation, and replace the carbon-intensive assets with cheaper and cleaner ones?\n        More critical for utilities and our societies, this tariff encourages consumers to shift loads as EVs or heat pumps to higher margin units (solar-produced kWh) instead of carbon-intensive ones produced with fossil fuel. The global energy consumption may increase by 50% in 2050. We want this increase to be matched with only low carbon emission energy sources.\n\n        Does the universal solar tariff exist already? Can I sign up for it?\n        As I am aware, there is no such tariff proposed to consumer at this time. Electricity markets are complex, and there are many regulations and limitations to what companies can do or not do. The system has been designed and operated with legacy technologies (coal, gas, hydro, sometimes nuclear) in mind for a long time.\n        The universal solar tariff is one example of an innovative product for energy consumers and how a different optimization logic at the system level creates more value from renewable energies.\n\nImage: [image\\UniversalSolarTariff.png] — \"The Universal Solar Tariff\"\nImage: [image\\solar_growth.png] — \"The amazing growth of solar\"\nImage: [image\\share_solar.png] — \"Share of solar in electricity consumption\"\nImage: [image\\solar_japan.png] — \"Solar homes in Japan\"\nImage: [image\\solar_park.png] — \"Solar on parking lots\"\nImage: [image\\solar_tariff_benchmark.png] — \"Universal Solar Tariff benchmark\"\nImage: [image\\Duck_curve.jpeg] — \"Duck curve\"\nImage: [image\\ChargeHQ.png] — \"Charge HQ's APP\""

    "content": "Dear Dr. Peterson,\n\n        I have followed your work for some time now. Recently, you became much more vocal on the climate change topic, and you seem to stand side by side with notorious climate denialists and the fossil fuel lobby groups.\n\n        I want to understand how someone like you refuses to acknowledge the work of the IPCC scientific community. Why would you ignore the warnings of science? You seem a man obsessed with the truth, with meaning, and the quality of life (purpose, social contribution). You claim to aim at a higher standard of life (emotional, intellectual, spiritual, ethical).\n\n        Would accepting these scientific facts be a too-traumatic personal experience? Are you protecting yourself and your lifestyle? It seems you refuse to look into the darkness of the climate reality. This reality can be very confronting for a man of values like you. My own reckoning was very painful. Yes, we all have been making the wrong choices for too long (enjoying the benefits of fossil fuels and closing our eyes to their negative impacts on the environment). Yes, humanity once again puts itself on a dangerous path.\n\n        The human race is capable of the best (love, art, science) but also of the worst (slavery, child labor, torture, war, holocaust, mass extermination). Unfortunately, humans are well capable of creating hell on earth. The sudden man-made global warming and the recent collapse of biodiversity will have long-term consequences putting several future generations at risk. I know you care about your children. But what about other children, what about your grandchildren, and their descendants? We have no right to cancel their future.\n\n        Nobody is coming to save the earth's biodiversity or the human race. We need to own our mistakes. Going out of this perilous trajectory will require tremendous collective efforts and changes. The developed western world needs to lead and show how a prosperous and free economy can be sustainable. Humanity has always learned and recovered from its errors, it changed course, creating new civilizations to survive and progress.\n\n        I encourage you to look deeper into the darkness of the climate reality and to go through the personal struggle of challenging your current understanding of the situation. What you will discover will scare you to the bones, and you may suffer climate anxiety like many younger people. The complexity and the scale of the work to be done may freeze you. We are indeed surrounded by fossil fuels. But if you look long enough, you may see the light and realize that many people are now dedicated to helping humanity change its course in time, keep the Paris Agreement alive, and preserve our garden of Eden. We still have a small window of opportunity to do so.\n\n        Please don't tell me climate activists are looking for a catastrophic event where there is none. Please don't tell me there is no emergency. It is not about finding a personal purpose or meaning in life; it is about rising to the challenge. The science is clear, the risks are real and already materializing.\n\n        I am sure you admire the following personalities: Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr, Mahatma Gandhi, Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela, Mikhail Gorbachev, or Lee Kuan Yew. These people decided to stand for a vision and values, they fought for them, and by doing so, they allowed positive collective actions to succeed and transformed our societies. Only courageous men and women of values can lead and make a difference.\n\n        Please look again at the dark climate reality, please meet and discuss with more experts in this field. With an open mind, you may see the light!\n\n        Yours faithfully,\n        Nicolas Payen\n\nImage: [image\\cover.png] — \"Letter to Dr. Jordan B. Peterson\""

    "title": "Unlocking Energy Efficiency: Exploring Energy Performance Contracts (EPC)",
    "content": "An Energy Performance Contract (EPC) is a contractual agreement that guarantees energy savings and operational improvements in a facility or industrial process through the implementation of energy efficiency measures.\n\n        The three main ways to decarbonize our economy in the coming years are:\n        \n            Electrification,\n            Renewable Energy and Energy Storage,\n            Energy/Carbon Efficiency.\n        \n        Energy Performance Contracts (EPCs) play a key role in financing Carbon/Energy Efficiency projects.\n\n        Energy Performance Contracts are commonly associated with projects in buildings or facilities, such as energy efficiency retrofits, building automation systems, lighting upgrades, HVAC system improvements, and renewable energy installations.EPCs can also be applied to industrial processes, focusing on optimizing energy efficiency, reducing waste, and improving overall operational performance. Examples of industrial process projects under EPCs include equipment upgrades, process optimization, waste heat recovery, cogeneration systems, and renewable energy integration.\n\n        In my last article, I discussed the Do's and Don'ts for Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). PPAs are important instruments for the electrification process and renewable energy growth. Many people are familiar with PPAs, so let's explore the specificities and similarities of these contracts with EPCs.\n\n        What is an Energy Performance Contract?\n        \n        An EPC is a contractual agreement between an energy service company (ESCO) and a client, where the ESCO agrees to design, implement, and finance energy efficiency measures to achieve specified energy savings targets.\n        \n        In an EPC, the ESCO typically assumes financial responsibility for implementing the energy efficiency measures, including the upfront investment, and receives compensation based on the achieved energy savings or a predetermined payment structure.\n        \n        Revenue in an EPC is derived from the cost savings achieved through reduced energy consumption and operational expenses resulting from the implemented energy efficiency measures.\n\n        The performance of an EPC is measured based on the achieved energy savings compared to a baseline or historical consumption data, as well as adherence to the agreed-upon energy efficiency targets and performance indicators.\n\n        Comparison with PPAs\n        Both EPCs and PPAs are typically long-term contractual agreements, often spanning several years, to ensure a stable and predictable relationship between the involved parties.\n\n        Both agreements involve some degree of risk-sharing between the parties. In PPAs, risks related to project performance, electricity price fluctuations, and market conditions are typically allocated between the project developer and the off-taker. In EPCs, risks associated with energy savings performance, project implementation, and maintenance are shared between the ESCO and the client.\n\n        Both agreements can provide financial benefits to the parties involved. PPAs allow project developers to secure long-term revenue streams and attract financing for renewable energy projects. EPCs enable clients to reduce energy costs, improve operational efficiency, and enhance the value and marketability of their facilities. EPCs also allow ESCOs to secure financing for energy efficiency projects.\n\n        Baseline Considerations in EPCs\n        In Energy Performance Contracts, the definition and determination of the baseline is a critical aspect that can pose challenges. The baseline serves as a reference point against which the energy savings achieved through the implemented energy efficiency measures are measured.\n\n        Here are 5 key considerations related to the baseline in EPCs:\n        \n            Establishing the baseline: The baseline represents the energy consumption or performance of the facility or system before the energy efficiency measures are implemented. It should be established using historical data, measurements, or modeling techniques.\n            Data availability and quality: Accurate and comprehensive data on energy consumption, operating hours, weather conditions, and occupancy levels are essential for establishing a robust baseline.\n            Adjustments: Factors like changes in occupancy, production levels, or weather conditions may impact energy usage, requiring normalization techniques to establish a more accurate baseline.\n            Measurement and Verification (M&V): M&V protocols ensure accurate measurement of savings through ongoing monitoring, data collection, and reporting.\n            Standardization and Guidelines: Standards like the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) provide best practices for baseline determination and M&V in EPCs.\n        \n\n        Establishing the baseline should involve collaboration and agreement between the ESCO and the client. Clear communication on baseline methodology, data sources, and assumptions is essential to avoid disputes.\n\n        Leasing Contracts as a Framework for EPCs and PPAs\n        Establishing the baseline should involve collaboration and agreement between the ESCO and the client. Clear communication, understanding, and consensus on the baseline methodology, data sources, adjustments, and assumptions are essential to avoid disputes or misunderstandings throughout the contract duration. It's important to address the baseline determination challenges upfront and establish a robust methodology that considers the specific characteristics and complexities of the facility or system undergoing energy efficiency improvements. This helps ensure accurate measurement of energy savings and the fair evaluation of the success of the EPC.\n        Leasing contracts for equipment can serve as a valuable framework for implementing both Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and Energy Performance Contracts (EPCs). In the context of PPAs, equipment leasing allows renewable energy developers or providers to install and maintain energy generation systems, such as solar panels or wind turbines, on the customer's premises. The customer benefits from accessing clean energy without upfront costs, while the provider retains ownership of the equipment and sells the generated energy to the customer at an agreed-upon price. Similarly, in EPCs, leasing arrangements can facilitate the deployment of energy-efficient equipment or technologies. The lessor assumes responsibility for the upfront investment and installation, while the lessee pays for the equipment usage through the achieved energy savings.\n        By leveraging leasing contracts, both PPAs and EPCs offer flexibility, affordability, and risk mitigation, enabling businesses and organizations to embrace renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions with greater ease.\n\n        PPA and EPC are very usefull tools to reduce energy bills and GHG emissions\n\nImage: [image\\cover.jpeg] — \"Unlocking Energy Efficiency: Exploring Energy Performance Contracts (EPC)\""

    "content": "The playbook used by the fossil fuel industry is very similar in many ways to the one used in the past by the Tobacco industry!\n\n        Hidden Dangers: Just as the harmful effects of smoking were concealed by the tobacco industry, the fossil fuel industry has downplayed the environmental consequences of burning fossil fuels, such as climate change.\n\n        Lobbying Power: Both industries have employed powerful lobbying tactics to influence government policies and regulations in their favor, hindering efforts to address public health and environmental concerns.\n\n        Denial of Scientific Evidence: Similar to tobacco companies denying the link between smoking and health risks, some fossil fuel companies have denied or cast doubt on the scientific consensus surrounding climate change.\n\n        Manipulating Public Perception: Both industries have used advertising and public relations strategies to shape public opinion, creating doubt and confusion about the negative impacts of their products.\n\n        Targeting Vulnerable Populations: Tobacco companies targeted specific demographics, such as youth and disadvantaged communities. Similarly, fossil fuel companies have disproportionately impacted marginalized communities through the siting of polluting facilities.\n\n        Addiction and Dependence: Just as tobacco addiction kept smokers reliant on cigarettes, society's dependence on fossil fuels has made it difficult to transition to cleaner energy sources. Fossil fuel industries also promote fake safe substitutes or solutions for their hazardous products (non-green hydrogen, carbon capture, carbon offset).\n\n        Externalizing Costs: Both industries have sought to shift the financial burden of their negative impacts onto society, rather than taking responsibility for the health and environmental costs associated with their products.\n\n        Influencing Scientific Research: Both industries have attempted to influence scientific research and experts to downplay the negative effects of their products or promote industry-friendly narratives.\n\n        Litigation and Legal Battles: Both industries have faced lawsuits and legal challenges, seeking accountability for the harm caused by their products and deceptive practices.\n\n        Transition Challenges: As the harmful effects of tobacco became widely recognized, the tobacco industry faced the challenge of transitioning to alternative products. Similarly, the fossil fuel industry is grappling with the need to transition to renewable energy sources in order to address climate change.\n\n        These analogies highlight the similarities in strategies and tactics employed by the tobacco and fossil fuel industries to protect their interests despite the negative consequences for public health and the environment of their products.\n\nImage: [image\\cover.png] — \"10 analogies between the tobacco industry and the fossil fuel industry\""

    "title": "Are Behind-the-Meter Battery Energy Storage Systems the Secret Enabler of Our 2030 Climate Targets?",
    "content": "Context\n        The world aims to at least triple its Renewable Energy capacity and double its Energy Efficiency by 2030 to reach its climate targets. The USA, the EU, and China have set aggressive targets to build power infrastructure to support a massive fleet of Electric Vehicles and Heat Pumps, reducing GHG emissions and fossil fuel dependency through electrification.\n\n        However, the task is immense, with six major hurdles:\n        \n        \n            Slow permitting and authorization process for renewable energy and storage projects.\n            Long interconnection queues for grid-tied assets.\n            Late grid upgrades and digitalization to support high Renewable Energy penetration.\n            Weak supply chain for key materials and workforce availability.\n            Financial Market volatility (inflation, interest rates) impacting clean energy investment (costs of equity and debt).\n            Potential negative cost impacts for energy consumers.\n        \n        \n        In this article, I will share my thoughts on how behind-the-meter Battery Energy Storage systems can be critical in addressing some of these challenges.\n\n        Bottom-up Approach\n        I used my home as a case study for exploring Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). Having decarbonized my household with solar panels (7kWp), a smart heating system, and a hybrid car, I am now evaluating the next steps: switching to an EV, installing a heat pump, and adding a home battery.\n\n        When building my plan, I always try to find an optimal solution for not only our family  (save on energy bills and reduce our GHG emissions)  but also at the system level  (contribution to the overall energy system from cost and GHG reductions). I also evaluate the replicability of such a plan to other households. As part of this personal project, I did some analysis and research to identify and quantify the potential benefits of installing a home Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). In my situation, I am not interested in grid backup or off-grid capabilities. I live in the Netherlands, and the electricity providers are highly reliable. My interest lies in reducing my energy bill and carbon footprint by maximizing the quantity of the low-carbon electricity I consume.\n        For this, I evaluated how a home energy storage solution can impact the demand profile of my house . The demand profile is very important because every kWh consumed needs to be matched by a kWh on the generation side. The electricity grid operator has to balance the demand with the supply side constantly. Traditionally, the supply side did most of this balancing work, but with the intermittency of renewables, the demand side plays an increasing role.\n\n        Impact of Batteries on a Home's Load Profile\n        To determine the impact of a BEES on my home's demand profile, I ran several simulations for various battery capacities.\n         The graphs cover two years of my consumption and show clearly the peak of solar generation during the summer months (blue). It also shows a typical house energy consumption with two tariffs (off-peak in green and peak hours in brown).\n        For the simulation, I assume conservatively that the battery will do a single full cycle per day.\n        Based on this analysis, a 10kWh home battery seems the sweet spot  for my home from a technical and decarbonization point of view. Maximum positive impacts can be achieved with a 15 kWh battery.\n        \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        As you can see on the graphs, the BEES delivers several important benefits. \n        \n            \n                It increases the amount of rooftop solar energy consumed (yellow).\n                It reduces the amount of solar energy exported to the grid to avoid congestion and negative pricing (blue).\n                It reduces the electricity consumption during peak hours (brown).\n                It maximizes the energy used during non-peak hours (green).\n            \n        \n\n        The battery achieves this by virtually shifting load and production and by reducing the amount of solar energy exported to the grid by 70%. At the same time, it doubles the amount of solar energy consumed directly in the home. It means the home battery can reduce the peak inflow of solar energy during the summer into the network by up to 30%.\n        \n            \n            \n        \n        It is tempting to oversize the battery slightly as the benefits will be even higher once our family has added a heat pump to our house and/or an electric vehicle and so increase our overall electricity consumption.\n        An electricity grid is a bit like our road network. You have small, medium, and large roads, and you also have highways and bridges. The more cars are using the roads simultaneously, the more likely you will face congestion somewhere.\n        Adding BESS on the electricity network behind the meters allows you to add into the mix much more renewable energy without costly grid upgrades (not only rooftop solar but also grid-tied solar and wind power plants). These systems can easily integrate all the required logic (electricity tariffs and solar generation optimizations) and do not require advanced smart meters.\n        BESS could become even more interesting when coupled with dynamic tariffs. Dynamic tariffs reflect almost in real time the electricity market prices and the imbalance between demand and supply. Such tariffs, when using smart BESS, can support even further the integration of Wind and Solar energy into the mix by providing flexibility and preventing the usage of gas-peaker plants.\n        Home BESS is a very attractive solution from a decarbonization point at households and system levels. It explains why such systems have succeeded in Australia, California, Texas, and Germany.\n        \n            \n            \n        \n        Financial Analysis\n        Before getting too excited about the benefit of BESS, I wanted to check if it makes sense financially for our family to invest in such equipment. In the table below, I calculated the potential savings on our energy bill for different sizes of BESS. The calculation below uses my household electricity prices and feed-in tariff structure. It may not be relevant for other countries than the Netherlands. \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        With a 10kWh battery, I can save today 600 euros per year, resulting in a payback time of just above ten years, assuming, very conservatively, that electricity price does not increase in the coming years. To maximize the home battery capacity while limiting the initial investment, I am considering using the battery of my future EV as a home energy storage thanks to Vehicle-to-home (V2H) technology. \n        Permanent behind-the-meter storage provides more value to the grid and homeowners because it is always available. However, the  V2H provides greater capacity at a lower cost  as the battery is mutualized for two usages. A household will likely consume the most energy when the car is parked in the driveway. On the other hand, the absence of a car during the daytime can prevent effective solar generation shifting.\n\n        Conclusion\n        The Netherlands has excelled in solar adoption, with 25% of households having rooftop systems at at the end of 2022 (1044Wps per Capita).\n        \n            \n            \n        \n        BESS offers a chance to further leverage this success, though payback periods need to shorten for broader adoption. Government incentives could make BESS more accessible, contributing private capital to the energy transition.\n\n        For households to invest in new equipment, a payback time closer to 5 years is needed. It means the end-consumer price of such BESS must still be reduced by at least 40%. Battery prices have decreased significantly in the last few years. Still, if the regulator wants to see these systems in many Dutch homes, they must integrate a financial support scheme to motivate consumers to invest. \n\n        Unfortunately, the latest changes in tariffs and solar feed-in tariffs made the business case for BESS even less attractive. Integrating BESS into their subsidy programs can be attractive for the Dutch authorities as it is a good way to get more private capital to finance the energy transition. Indeed, individual consumers can pay for part of their energy storage equipment while delivering value to the overall electricity system and all other network consumers.\n\n        We need to scale multiple solutions to do the energy transition. And behind-the-meter solutions are complementary to large grid-tied ones. Like with the rock, pebble, sand, and water experiment to fill up a jar, there are plenty of levers we can use to maximize the utilization and the efficiency of the electricity grid.\n\n        Note: If you are interested in this topic or would like to understand more in detail the simulations, then do not hesitate to reach out. .\n\nImage: [image\\cover.png] — \"Are behind-the-meter battery energy storage systems the secret enabler of our 2030 climate targets?\"\nImage: [image\\simulation_home.png] — \"Impact of various home battery capacity on my home's load profile\"\nImage: [image\\calculation_impact.png] — \"Impact of various home battery capacity on my home energy balance\"\nImage: [image\\energy_storage_growth.jpeg] — \"Energy Storage Growth in Germany\"\nImage: [image\\finance_calculation.png] — \"Payback calculation for various home battery capacities for my home\"\nImage: [image\\solar.png] — \"Penetration of solar in Europe\""

    "title": "2023 was a Great Year for Climate Tech Investors",
    "content": "In the last 18 months, I have been working more actively on managing and defining a securities portfolio. I aimed to create a portfolio reflecting my values and investment philosophy.\n\n        I would describe myself as a \"Growth value investor.\" I buy and hold securities for the long term (over several years). I do not buy derivatives and do not short stocks. I am investing in companies positioned in fast-growing markets, but I also want to invest at a fair value.\n\n        Buying \"growth companies\" at fair value is a real challenge as the market consistently prices in its growth expectations. Consequently, growth companies always have higher valuations and are generally more expensive. I try to buy these stocks when the market undervalues them.\n\n        I also consider myself an \"impact investor\". I invest in companies that deliver positive impacts to society. My primary motivation when creating my portfolio was to exclude specific sectors I did not want to support with my money. These sectors were all fossil fuels, tobacco, and military supply.\n\n        It is complicated to exclude these sectors as most indexes and associated ETFs have solid exposure to them (especially for fossil fuels). Very few asset managers have excluded O&G activities from their investment strategies.\n\n        The \"4Gs\" Portfolio\n        My current investment strategy relies on four dimensions, which I named the \"4Gs\" portfolio. It reflects my area of interest and past experiences. The 4Gs stand for:\n\n        \n            Gray or Healthcare Tech: Companies providing products and services to cater to our aging population. (40-45% of the portfolio)\n            Green or Climate Tech: Companies supporting climate mitigation and the energy transition. (35-40% of the portfolio)\n            Gratification or Generational Tech: Companies focused on entertainment and lifestyle. (15-25% of the portfolio)\n            Global: I invest globally, prioritizing the company's value over location. This includes exposure to various currencies, with non-US, non-EU securities at 10-15% today.\n        \n\n        \n            \n            \n        \n\n        I use simple tools to manage my portfolio, relying on Yahoo Finance, Simply Wall Street, and Excel. I read company reports, join earnings calls, and stay informed about portfolio companies and their competitors. My portfolio includes 40-50 stocks, and I monitor 20-30 more as potential investments. I follow another 100-150 listed companies, mainly Climate Tech related.\n\n        All dividends are reinvested in the portfolio to compound. Below is an overview of the portfolio's 2023 performance excluding dividends and before taxes.\n\n        2023 Performance\n        The 4Gs portfolio ended 2023 with a 19% gain, just below the S&P500 and on par with the EuroStoxx 50. The portfolio's volatility was close to the S&P 500's.\n\n        \n            \n            \n        \n\n        Climate Tech, despite a volatile year, closed at +25%. \n        Health Tech saw a modest 11% gain, outperforming the overall healthcare sector in the S&P 500.\n        Generational/Gratification Tech led with a 29% increase, primarily due to its tech companies' performance. \n        The '4Gs' portfolio performance was negatively impacted by the performance of the non-US-EU companies (mainly China in fact). Chinese equities suffered extensively in 2023. And most Asian currencies have been very weak in 2023 compared to the USD and Euro.\n\n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n        Top Holdings\n        As of early 2024, the fiftheen biggest holdings in the 4Gs portfolio include:\n        Air Liquide, Alphabet, Apple, EssilorLuxottica, General Electric, Kering, Longi Green Energy Technology, LVMH, Microsoft, Netflix, NextEra Energy Inc, Schneider Electric, Tesla, Sonova, and Waste Management.\n\n        Why I Enjoy Investing\n        People often ask me why I like managing my portfolio and making such investments. A very relevant and attractive investment strategy would be to invest in an Index like the S&P500 through an ETF.\n\n        I find it a fascinating intellectual exercise as it requires accumulating and analyzing a lot of information about the world: technologies, companies, markets, and all other various forces that influence our societies and economies.\n\n        It is also a fantastic personal exercise for self-awareness. Investors need to have an excellent understanding of themself to understand how their biases and emotions can influence their decisions. Investors need also to be aware of others' emotions and biases.\n\n        It is difficult to not fall down this fantastic rabbit hole!\n\n        Let’s see what 2024 has to offer!\n        Disclaimer\n        \n        NO INVESTMENT ADVICE\n        The Content is for informational purposes only, you should not construe any such information or other material as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

    "title": "Charting the Skies: The Start-up Journey as an Epic Fligh",
    "content": "I enjoy running; I try to do it regularly. When I run, I notice my mind gains clarity, and my decisions improve. During one of my recent long runs, I thought about my journey as an entrepreneur and how difficult it can be for people to understand what it entails. The analogy with WWII gliders came to mind, mainly because I had to land my start-up to avoid crashing as I ran out of fuel. These gliders were towed into the air during D-day and then released, relying solely on aerodynamics and the skill of the pilot to reach their destination.\n\n        Embarking on the journey of a start-up is akin to piloting an aircraft on an ambitious expedition into uncharted skies. It begins with a bold vision of reaching new horizons—a destination of innovation, success, and impact. But unlike conventional flights, there isn’t a fully assembled plane waiting on the tarmac. Instead, you start with the skeleton of an idea, assembling the aircraft as you accelerate down the runway.\n        \n        Flight Plan as Business Strategy \n        Before any flight takes off, a meticulous flight plan is crafted. This document outlines the route, altitude, fuel requirements, weather considerations, and contingency plans. Similarly, a start-up requires a well-thought-out business strategy. This plan maps out your goals, target market, financial projections, competitive analysis, and risk management strategies. It’s your roadmap to navigate the vast and often turbulent skies of the business world.\n        \n        Assembling on the Runway: Building the MVP\n        With limited resources, you and your team hastily construct the basic framework needed for takeoff—your minimum viable product (MVP). This is akin to assembling the essential parts of the plane on the runway, just enough to get airborne. Every component must justify its weight; unnecessary features are discarded to maximize efficiency and performance.\n        \n        Selecting the Right Crew: Team Building\n        Your team is your flight crew, each member carefully selected for their unique skills crucial to the mission. In the tight confines of a start-up, weight and efficiency are paramount. Having the right people in the right roles is essential. If a crew member isn’t contributing effectively, swift adjustments are necessary to maintain balance and performance.\n        \n        Pilot Training as Founder Preparedness\n        Just as pilots undergo extensive training before commanding an aircraft, a founder’s education, experience, and continuous learning are vital. This preparedness enables you to make informed decisions, navigate challenges, and lead your team through the complexities of the start-up journey.\n        \n        Runway Length as Market Opportunity Window\n        The length of the runway determines how much distance you have to achieve lift-off. In the start-up context, this represents the market opportunity window. You need to gain sufficient traction before competitors saturate the market or the opportunity diminishes. Timing is critical; delays can mean the difference between soaring success and missing the flight entirely.\n        \n        Takeoff with a Small Fuel Tank: Limited Resources\n        Your initial ascent relies on a tiny reserve of fuel—perhaps personal savings or seed funding . Every drop is precious. This limited fuel symbolizes the constrained resources most start-ups begin with. It necessitates meticulous budgeting, prioritizing essential expenditures, and finding creative ways to do more with less.\n        \n        Navigational Instruments as Data Analytics\n        Once airborne, you rely on navigational instruments —your data analytics and key performance indicators (KPIs)—to guide you. These tools provide real-time feedback on your start-up’s performance, helping you make informed decisions and adjust your course as needed.\n        \n        Weather Conditions as Market Dynamics\n        The weather plays a crucial role in aviation. Clear skies represent favorable market conditions, while storms symbolize economic downturns or disruptive competitors. You must be agile in adapting to shifting market dynamics, seizing opportunities, and avoiding potential threats.\n        \n        Air Traffic Control as Regulatory Bodies and Advisors\n        Throughout your journey, you stay in communication with air traffic control—regulatory bodies, mentors, and advisors. They provide critical information, ensure you’re operating within legal airspace, and offer guidance on navigating complex situations. Compliance and good counsel are essential for a safe and successful voyage.\n        \n        Gliding and Momentum: Early-Stage Survival\n        In the early stages, with limited fuel, much of your journey involves  gliding . You leverage whatever momentum you have, making the most of environmental factors like tailwinds—favorable market trends or efficiencies—that help you move forward without consuming precious resources. During this phase, you spend considerable time refining your design, optimizing processes, and seeking out opportunities that can carry you forward.\n        \n        Weight and Efficiency: Lean Operations\n        Every ounce of weight affects the aircraft’s performance. Unnecessary components are jettisoned to maximize efficiency. This reflects the start-up’s need to focus on core functionalities and maintain lean operations. It’s about delivering maximum value with minimal resources, ensuring that every effort contributes directly to your goals.\n        \n        Finding the Right Winds: Market Opportunities\n        Identifying and harnessing tailwinds is crucial. These favorable currents can significantly enhance your progress, representing market opportunities, emerging trends, or technological advancements. By positioning your start-up to capitalize on these winds, you gain additional lift without expending extra fuel.\n        \n        Crew Communication as Team Collaboration\n        Effective communication among the crew ensures everyone is coordinated and aware of their responsibilities. In a start-up, fostering open communication and a collaborative culture promotes innovation, accelerates problem-solving, and keeps the team aligned with the company’s vision.\n        \n        Mid-Air Refueling: Securing Additional Funding\n        If luck and skill are on your side, opportunities arise to refuel while flying. This could be securing venture capital, attracting angel investors, or generating early revenue streams. Each successful infusion of resources extends your range, allowing you to reach new milestones and invest in further improvements.\n        \n        Passengers as Customers\n        Your passengers are your customers—the reason your flight exists. Their satisfaction and loyalty are paramount. Just as airlines strive to provide a comfortable and enjoyable experience, your start-up must prioritize customer needs, delivering exceptional value and building strong relationships. \n        \n        In-Flight Entertainment as Customer Experience Enhancements\n        Offering amenities like in-flight entertainment enhances passenger satisfaction. Similarly, in a competitive market, differentiating your start-up through superior customer experience, personalized services, or unique product features can set you apart from competitors.\n        \n        Emergency Protocols as Risk Management Strategies\n        Pilots are trained to handle emergencies with predefined protocols. Start-ups need robust risk management strategies to navigate potential crises such as cash flow shortages, legal challenges, or sudden market shifts. Being prepared enables you to respond effectively without jeopardizing the company’s future.\n        \n        Black Box as Learning from Failures\n        Aircraft are equipped with a black box that records flight data and cockpit communications, invaluable for understanding failures after an incident. In a start-up, maintaining detailed records and analyzing both successes and failures is essential for continuous learning and improvement.\n        \n        Upgrades and Maintenance as Continuous Improvement\n        Aircraft require regular maintenance and upgrades to remain safe and efficient. Similarly, your start-up must engage in continuous improvement—updating technologies, refining products, and optimizing processes. This ongoing evolution is critical to staying relevant and competitive in a rapidly changing market.\n        \n        Scaling Heights: Growth and Expansion\n        As you refine your design and processes, your aircraft becomes more capable of reaching higher altitudes. Climbing to these higher altitudes offers smoother conditions and better efficiency . In business terms, this represents scaling your start-up, expanding into new markets, and leveraging economies of scale.\n        \n        Navigating Turbulence: Overcoming Challenges\n        No flight is without turbulence. Unexpected challenges—be it technical glitches, market volatility, or fierce competition—are inevitable. How you respond determines your course. Adjusting strategies is like a pilot altering altitude or route to find smoother air. Resilience and adaptability are your allies in navigating these rough patches.\n        \n        \n        Environmental Stewardship: Sustainable Practices\n        Emphasizing fuel efficiency and sustainable practices not only reduces costs but also appeals to environmentally conscious customers and investors. Incorporating sustainability into your business model can enhance your brand’s reputation and contribute to long-term success.\n        \n        \n        Layovers and Pivots\n        Sometimes, the journey requires a layover—a pause or a change in direction. In the start-up world, this could mean a pivot, adjusting your business model or product offering based on new insights or market feedback. Flexibility is crucial, allowing you to realign your course toward more promising horizons.\n        Destination as Exit Strategy\n        Every flight has a destination. For a start-up, this could represent achieving market leadership, being acquired, or launching an IPO. Planning for this endpoint helps shape decisions along the journey, ensuring that each step brings you closer to your ultimate goal.\n        \n        Final Approach: Preparing for Success\n        As you approach your destination, you begin your descent, preparing for landing. This stage reflects scaling the business, executing your exit strategy, or reaching significant milestones. It requires careful planning and execution to ensure a smooth transition and successful outcome.\n        \n        Touchdown and Beyond: New Beginnings\n        Touching down signifies achieving a major milestone. There’s a sense of accomplishment, but also the recognition that this destination is a new starting point. Just as passengers disembark to explore new places, reaching your goal opens up fresh opportunities for growth, innovation, and impact.\n        \n        Frequent Flyer Programs as Customer Loyalty Initiatives\n        Building a loyal customer base is akin to airlines offering frequent flyer programs. Implementing loyalty initiatives encourages repeat business and fosters strong relationships. In a start-up, nurturing customer loyalty can lead to sustained revenue and a solid foundation for future expansion.\n        \n        Ongoing Vigilance and Adaptation\n        Even as you soar at cruising altitude, vigilance is essential. The environment can change rapidly—new competitors emerge, market conditions shift, or technological advancements disrupt the status quo. Continuous innovation and a willingness to adapt keep you ahead of potential challenges.\n        \n        The Endless Journey of Innovation\n        The flight doesn’t have a fixed endpoint. Each successful leg of the journey opens new possibilities for exploration and growth. With the right crew, efficient design, strategic resource management, and a relentless pursuit of excellence, you transform the act of flying into an endless voyage of discovery and achievement.\n\nImage: [image\\cover.jpeg] — \"Charting the sky\""

    "title": "Leadership at the Crossroads of Brain and Gut",
    "content": "Leadership is about balance. At its core, I see it as aligning vision, a sense of urgency, and a learning culture, all guided by the dynamics of brain, guts, and ethics.\n\n            Key Dimensions\n            \n                Shared Vision: Provides the “why”—a common purpose that inspires and aligns. Without it, motivation falters.\n                Urgency for Results: Drives momentum, ensuring the vision is acted upon. Without it, even the clearest goals can stagnate.\n                Learning Culture: Creates a win-win alignment between the organization and the individual. Learnings are also synonymous with progress—without them, the energy to pursue the vision wanes.\n            \n\n            Examples\n            Example 1: Imagine leading a company trying to break into a competitive new market. The vision might focus on becoming a leader in renewable energy, an inspiring goal that resonates with customers and employees alike. However, the urgency for results drives the team to secure a first-mover advantage, launching key products ahead of competitors. At the same time, a learning culture ensures that setbacks—like missed deadlines or product adjustments—are opportunities for growth, allowing the team to refine its strategy while staying motivated to achieve the larger goal.\n\n            Example 2: Now, consider a more pragmatic example: A team is developing an innovative but risky product that could transform the business. The vision is exciting, but after assessing market trends and available resources, the decision is made to scale back the project and focus on incremental improvements instead. While this may feel like a compromise, it preserves the organization’s ability to execute on its broader goals, keeps the timeline realistic, and avoids draining resources unnecessarily. Communicating this decision as part of a long-term vision ensures the team remains motivated and sees the value in a measured approach.\n\n            Decision-Making: Brain and Guts\n            \n                The Brain: Offers clarity, logic, and structure—paramount for effective decision-making.\n                The Gut: Provides intuition, sensing when something feels off or when the brain’s reasoning might be weak.\n            \n            Both are imperfect. The brain can overanalyze or miss subtle signals, while the gut can be swayed by emotion or misjudgment. That’s why they require mutual monitoring—a balance where intuition checks reasoning, and logic grounds instinct.\n\n            Moral Compass\n            When the gut is triggered, it often prompts a deeper moral compass check. Is this discomfort pointing to a misalignment with the team, the vision, or the values? The decision then becomes: should I adjust course or encourage introspection in others and myself?\n\n            Conclusion\n            Ultimately, leadership manages this dynamic interplay while staying true to what matters most. Matured leadership is also understanding that multiple paths can lead to various positive outcomes. Grit pushes us forward, but stubbornness risks failure. Timing is critical but elusive. By balancing vision, urgency, and learning with the clarity of the brain, the intuition of the gut, and the guidance of ethics, we can make decisions that are not only effective but meaningful.\n\n            How do you navigate the imperfections of brain and gut in your leadership journey?\n\nImage: [image\\cover.png] — \"Brain & Guts\""

    "title": "The AI Running Dinner Challenge, Fight of the Giants",
    "content": "AI running dinner challenge, the fight of giants\n            \n        \n        \n            Eveline, my wife, embarked on an exciting yet complex challenge: organizing a running dinner for our 27 neighbors . A running dinner involves coordinating multiple homes for various courses, with guests moving between locations throughout the evening. The complexity of defining a route plan that ensures everyone meets new people, respects constraints, and maintains an enjoyable flow was more daunting than we initially thought.\n\n            Given the challenge, Eveline decided to see if an AI tool could help. My expectation? That AI would, if properly prompted, swiftly analyze the data, manage the constraints, and deliver an optimal route plan. Reality, however, proved far more intricate.\n\n            The AI Experiment\n\n            I started with OpenAI, which is my daily go-to AI engine. But I realized after several attempts that OpenAI was not up to the tasks and could not provide me with accurate solutions for our complex requests.\n            \n            I approached several AI engines with the same task. I created a single PDF document with all the relevant information for the prompt: a list of the 27 houses, a dish assignment for each house, the running dinner rules (like no overlap), and some constraints. Then, I asked the AI engines to help us and propose a valid route plan. We started first with just the list of houses with their assigned dishes (simple requests), and then we added some specific requirements, such as a particular house not being allowed to be paired with another given house, etc. (complex requests).\n            \n            The goal was to find an AI tool capable of navigating the complexity of social dynamics, logistical constraints, and multiple variables. The results were enlightening—and a little surprising.\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        AI Engine\n                        Ranking\n                        Flag\n                        Description\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Gemini Pro\n                        ⭐⭐⭐⭐\n                        🟨\n                        Understood the problem and described the work to be done.

The process was far from \"plug and play.\"\n                Elon's AI Victory Lap: Surprisingly—or perhaps not—Elon Musk's xAI Grok came out on top, managing to crack the dinner code. Maybe it's the result of the vast NVIDIA-powered data centers, or maybe it's just luck. Either way, some might find it amusing (or slightly irritating) that Grok succeeded where others didn't. Looking at Grok working its way through this problem was mesmerizing.\n                AI Thinking Power: It's no coincidence that OpenAI and xAI are leading in AI infrastructure. Both boast massive AI data centers with thousands of NVIDIA chips fueling their thinking power. While OpenAI's infrastructure is formidable, xAI seems to have found the right \"recipe\" for this challenge. In June 2024, xAI reported having 200,000 of Nvidia’s H100 graphic chipset.\n                Complexity Challenges: Simple requests were manageable for only three AI engines, but complexity brought significant hurdles. Only one could adapt and refine its responses effectively.\n                Understanding Constraints: While most AI tools could understand the problem, applying constraints correctly and flexibly proved challenging, moving from an automatic response generation, to a mix of automatic route generation, followed by automatic verification, followed by 'automatic correction' of the algorithm or the outcome seemed to be the secret weapon of xAI. Most other AI engines were unable to identify their own mistakes and take corrective actions.\n                Regional Limitations: Accessibility can be a concern, as seen with Lama, which wasn’t available for testing in Europe.\n            \n\n            Conclusion\n            Our AI Running Dinner Challenge revealed that while AI holds great promise in solving complex logistical tasks, it's not yet a magic bullet. The process requires patience, iterative testing, and an understanding of the AI’s limitations.\n\n            Nonetheless, the experience was valuable, offering insights into how AI can assist (and where it still falls short) in real-world problem-solving. It turned out that human intuition and adaptability remain essential, even in the era of advanced AI.\n\n            Would we use AI again for such tasks? Absolutely—but with the understanding that it's more of a collaborative partner than an all-knowing solution.\n\n            And if Elon Musk's AI manages to crack it again, well, let's just hope it invites us to the after-party!\n\n            Have you tried using AI for complex event planning? I’d love to hear your experiences!\n\nImage: [image\\cover.jpg] — \"AI running dinner challenge\""

    "content": "Enhancing Smart EV Charging for a Sustainable Future\n            \n        \n        \n            Dear Mercedes-Benz and Easee Teams,\n\n            I hope this message finds you well. Over the past years, I have shared my journey toward a more sustainable home through two articles: How I Decarbonized My Home to Make Money\" and Behind-the-Meter Storage as a Key Enabler of the Energy Transition. These experiences reflect my commitment to sustainability and efficient energy use, and I now write to seek your attention on a pressing challenge I am facing.\n\n            Recent Sustainability Upgrades\n\n            Our household recently made significant strides towards greater sustainability. We invested in a hybrid heat pump from Quatt, reducing our reliance on traditional heating methods.\n            \n                \n                 Our family home with its new heat pump\n            \n\n            Additionally, we replaced our plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) with a fully electric family SUV from Mercedes-Benz. This transition marked an essential step toward decarbonizing our mobility and contributing to a cleaner future.\n            \n                \n                Our new electric family car\n            \n\n            Why Not Volvo EX90?\n\n            Although I was initially inclined to opt for the Volvo EX90 due to its promising Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) functionality, several factors led me to choose Mercedes-Benz instead. The uncertainty around the availability of V2H in the Netherlands and the lack of clear communication from Volvo and its dealership were concerning. Moreover, the market currently lacks widely available bi-directional EV chargers that support V2H, despite several players announcing new solutions recently.\n\n            The second-hand EV market also presents compelling opportunities at the moment. While the absence of V2H was a consideration, I am nonetheless delighted with our new EV. Every drive has been a joy, and we relished several memorable road trips across Europe this past winter.\n\n            The Current Challenge: Smart Charging Complexity\n\n            Without V2H functionality, I strive to optimize our existing system with smart charging solutions. To this end, I invested in an Easee Lite charger, attracted by its load shedding and solar optimization features—essential components for reducing costs and maximizing the use of solar energy.\n\n            However, the practical application of this system has proven less seamless than anticipated. Ideally, I aim to charge the EV at night up to a minimum specified battery percentage for daily commuting needs and then utilize excess solar energy during the day for additional charging when the car is parked. Having the car charged every morning with enough electricity to drive 200 to 300 km would be more than enough to cover all unplanned situations, so 50-60% battery charged would be sufficient unless we have a long trip planned. The rest of the battery could be further charged depending on the sunshine and our solar generation, absorbing excess solar energy whenever possible.\n\n            While theoretically straightforward, the current process presents many limitations and is unnecessarily manual:\n            \n                The Mercedes app allows me to set a maximum battery percentage but without scheduling capabilities.It means the max charging percentage if fixed during the day for a given location.\n                \n                The Easee system also lacks scheduling for switching between different charging modes. I can have a schedule that allows me to charge the car at a given time but I can not associate a charging mode to a given schedule and have two differents charging mode scheduled during a day.\n                \n                \n                    The two systems do not communicate, requiring manual adjustments.\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                The Easee and Mercedes APPs used to control EV charging\n            \n\n            The current process is unnecessarily manual and involves daily adjustments across both the Mercedes and Easee systems.\n\n            Urgency for Improved Solutions\n\n            The urgency for efficient smart charging solutions is heightened by the upcoming cancellation of the \"saldering\" set for 2027 in the Netherlands. Due to the cancellation of the Dutch feed-in tariff, it will not be longer possible to export solar power to the grid with financial compensation. This shift will significantly affect the financial return of solar energy systems, increasing the importance of directly consuming self-generated energy.\n\n            Looking forward, to further advance our decarbonization goals, our family is considering investing in a three-phase battery energy storage system. This would enhance our energy independence and allow for more efficient use of self-generated solar energy, especially as market conditions evolve.\n\n            Proposed Solution and Call for Collaboration\n\n            I believe this is an opportunity for Mercedes-Benz and Easee to collaborate and streamline smart charging processes for consumers. By enhancing communication between your platforms and introducing more flexible, automated scheduling features, you can significantly improve the user experience and promote greater energy efficiency.\n\n            I am open to further discussing potential solutions and how we can address these challenges together. Thank you for considering my feedback, and I look forward to hearing from you.\n\n            Best regards,\n            Nicolas Payen\n\nImage: [image\\cover.jpg] — \"Enhancing Smart EV Charging for a Sustainable Future\"\nImage: [./image/OurHeatPump.png] — \"Our family home with its new heat pump\"\nImage: [./image/OurEV.png] — \"Our new electric family car\"\nImage: [./image/APPs_view_EV_Charging.png] — \"The Easee and Mercedes APPs used to control EV charging\""

    "title": "Nuclear: It Is the Way (Too)",
    "content": "Finding a Sustainable Future for Nuclear Energy\n        \n    \n    Few technologies generate as much debate—or as much potential—in the global race to decarbonize as nuclear energy. It’s clean, reliable, and independent of weather or season. Yet, in today’s energy landscape, nuclear is struggling to compete.\n\n    This isn’t a failure of nuclear—it’s a reflection of how remarkably cost-effective solar, wind, and storage have become, increasingly squeezing nuclear out of the economic equation.\n\n    Renewables Rising\n    Over the past decade, renewable energy has surged forward.\n\n    Solar panels have become dramatically cheaper, more efficient, and widely deployed. Wind power has expanded across continents, and battery storage technologies are evolving rapidly. Together, these advances have fundamentally reshaped the economics of electricity generation—lowering costs and accelerating decarbonization.\n\n    We’re beginning to see the contours of a future energy system that is both clean and affordable. But this rapid transformation is not without trade-offs. One of them is that nuclear energy—despite its reliability and low-carbon profile—is increasingly being squeezed out of the market.\n\n    Negative electricity prices, once considered rare, are now a recurring feature in many markets. As renewable generation continues to grow and battery storage deployment takes time to scale, oversupply during periods of high solar and wind production will persist. In such a context, nuclear plants—designed to run continuously at high capacity—struggle to stay economically viable.\n\n    The recent, abrupt leadership change at EDF, the world’s largest nuclear power producer, underscores this tension. It’s a clear signal: finding a sustainable financial model for nuclear is becoming increasingly complex in a system built around variable renewables and marginal pricing.\n\n    The Nuclear Dilemma\n    Nuclear power thrives on consistency. It needs high capacity factors and near-perfect availability to remain financially viable. Unlike solar and wind, it doesn’t scale down easily. A nuclear plant that runs only part of the time is an economic disaster.\n\n    Historically, European Union regulations have granted priority access to the electricity grid for renewable energy sources to promote their development. This approach was formalized in Directive 2009/28/EC, which mandated that Member States ensure priority or guaranteed access for electricity produced from renewable sources . Specifically, Article 16(2)(c) of the directive states that Member States shall take appropriate steps to ensure that electricity from renewable energy sources has priority access or guaranteed access to the grid system. This legal framework was designed to facilitate the integration of renewables into the energy market, supporting the EU’s goals for sustainable energy production. That made sense at the time. But now, with renewables becoming the dominant force in new capacity additions, it may be time to rethink the rules.\n\n    If we want to keep nuclear in the mix—and we should—then it must be allowed to operate in a system that doesn’t penalize it for being constant.\n\n    A Fragile Ecosystem\n    Beyond economics, there’s another critical dimension: the nuclear supply chain and knowledge base. Nuclear is not plug-and-play. It relies on a highly specialized industrial ecosystem—engineers, regulators, safety experts, manufacturers of components and fuels—that takes decades to build and moments to lose.\n\n    Today, the nuclear sector supports over 1.1 million jobs across the European Union , spanning operations, construction, research, and manufacturing. In the UK alone, the civil nuclear supply chain employs nearly 87,000 people. These figures illustrate not just an energy source, but a deeply embedded industrial fabric.\n\n    Unlike wind or solar, where rapid scale-up is possible from a broad and flexible supplier base, nuclear demands continuity. If civilian nuclear projects decline too much, can military or research programs alone preserve the full depth of expertise and supply chain capabilities?\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            Share of nuclear power in electricity generation\n        \n    \n    It’s unlikely. Letting civilian nuclear infrastructure fade may mean losing the option altogether in the future—just when we might need it most.\n\n    Strategic Sovereignty and Nuclear Expertise\n    The war in Ukraine, renewed tensions in the Middle East, and a shifting global security landscape have all reinforced a hard truth: energy and defense are two sides of the same sovereignty coin.\n\n    While the civilian nuclear debate often centers around electricity economics and emissions, the strategic dimension of nuclear technology cannot be ignored. Nuclear deterrence remains a core element of security policy for several European states and NATO as a whole. But nuclear deterrence isn’t just about the warheads—it’s also about the people, the infrastructure, and the industrial capacity behind them.\n\n    Maintaining a sovereign nuclear deterrent or participating in shared security frameworks requires more than military doctrine. It requires a robust, local ecosystem of nuclear engineers, physicists, regulatory experts, and manufacturers. These are the same capabilities that underpin the civilian nuclear sector. If we let them erode in times of peace, we may not be able to rebuild them in times of crisis.\n\n    Civilian nuclear infrastructure plays a quiet but crucial role in strategic resilience. By continuing to invest in and protect these capabilities, Europe not only secures part of its energy transition—it also reinforces its geopolitical autonomy in an increasingly unstable world.\n\n    A Millefeuille Energy System\n    The future of energy isn’t about picking winners. It’s about orchestrating a mix—a layered system, like a millefeuille, where each technology plays its part based on its strengths.\n    \n      \n        Nuclear: the base layer—firm, stable, and carbon-free. It should get first priority, ensuring reliability and maintaining critical industrial capabilities.\n        Wind and solar: the renewable middle—cheap, clean, and abundant. They deserve priority access, but must be balanced within the broader system.\n        Storage & Flexibility: the glue between layers—filling gaps and smoothing volatility. This includes not just batteries, but Virtual Power Plants (VPPs), flexible loads, and demand-side response mechanisms that absorb excess generation and shift consumption in time to stabilize the grid.\n        Fossil fuels: the top layer—used only when no other option is available, and priced accordingly.\n    \n\n    This isn’t just a metaphor—it’s a roadmap. A well-structured millefeuille of technologies can deliver decarbonization, affordability, and resilience. But like any fine pastry, it needs careful layering, regulatory finesse, and long-term vision.\n     \n        \n        \n            \n            Share of nuclear power in electricity generation\n        \n    \n    We don’t need nuclear to lead the energy transition—but we do need it to be there when we need it most..\n\n    The Limits of the Market\n    The truth is, market forces alone seem unable to give nuclear energy its rightful place in a cost-optimized, low-carbon energy system. Nuclear may not need to dominate—but it may very well need regulatory support simply to survive, especially in an era of rising energy demand driven by the AI boom.\n\n    That support, however, must come with a clear and pragmatic purpose: not to pursue nuclear at any cost, but to ensure that it plays a meaningful role in reducing the overall system cost for consumers. Granting nuclear the highest level of priority on the network could be justified—but only if its share is intentionally capped, to avoid distorting market signals or driving up electricity prices.\n\n    System vs. Market\n     \n        \n          \n            PriorityLevel\n            System Logic(Resilience-Based) / Proposed\n            Market Logic(Price-Based) / As of today\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            0\n            Behind-the-meter generation, storage, optimisation\n            Behind-the-meter generation, storage, optimisation\n          \n          \n            1\n            Nuclear – Stable, carbon-free baseload for long-term and seasonal reliability\n            Wind & Solar – Zero marginal cost; always dispatched first under market rules\n          \n          \n            2\n            Wind & Solar – Cost-effective, clean bulk power; variable but increasingly dominant\n            Clean Energy Tariffs – These are not integrated in dispatch logic and only indirectly affect consumer behavior.

It values stability (nuclear), clean bulk power (wind & solar), flexibility (VPPs, DSR, storage), and behavioral alignment (tariffs) in a way that minimizes overall system costs and emissions.\n        On the right, Market Logic ranks resources by marginal cost and dispatchability. While this promotes short-term efficiency, it often under-rewards flexibility, penalizes inflexible baseload like nuclear, and gives limited economic value to behavioral signals or system-wide resilience.\n      \n    \n    The result? The very technologies that could optimize the grid long-term are often marginalized or mispriced.\n    To bridge this gap, market reforms must recognize and internalize system-level externalities—rewarding flexibility, clean capacity, and demand shaping, not just marginal energy cost.\n    \n \n    A Pragmatic Path Forward\n    Whether nuclear should account for 5%, 10%, or 20% of Europe’s future electricity mix—it currently stands at around 22% of EU electricity generation—remains an open and country-specific question. What seems increasingly clear, however, is that targeting much higher penetration across the EU, as some in the nuclear lobby advocate, may be unrealistic—and even counterproductive.\n    Instead, establishing a realistic, enforceable cap on nuclear’s role in the European energy mix, alongside the highest level of network priority, may offer a way forward: preserving a vital industrial and strategic capability while keeping system costs in check. It could be the balanced path that allows nuclear energy to endure and contribute, without distorting the economics of the broader energy transition.\n    It is also a deal that could unite both renewable energies advocates and nuclear energie advocates and create a winning coalition for electrification and the energy transition \n    It is time for France and Germany to find common ground on this issue—one that has remained unresolved for far too long. An abundant supply of clean, affordable energy is not a luxury but a strategic asset for Europe’s future. While each Member State will continue to shape its own national energy agenda, the EU urgently needs a clear, pragmatic roadmap that enables the coexistence and complementarity of renewables and nuclear power . Without such alignment at the European level, the energy transition risks becoming fragmented, inefficient—and ultimately much more expensive for European consumers.\n\nImage: [images\\cover.png] — \"Finding a future for Nuclear Energy\"\nImage: [images\\nuclear_share.png] — \"Share of Nuclear Power in electricity generation\"\nImage: [images\\millefeuilles.png] — \"Energy Mix mille Millefeuille\""

    "content": "Nicolas Payen's professional journey\n        \n            \n                Founder & CEO - Positive Energy Ltd.\n                March 2017 - December 2023: From Vision to Market Leader: The Story of a Climate Fintech \n                In 2017, while living in Singapore, fueled by a bold vision to transform the way sustainable energy projects are financed, I set out to build Positive Energy Ltd  from the ground up. I first gathered a group of experts through the INSEAD network to help me design the business and validate a concept using no-code prototypes.\n                Then I recruited a world-class team —including a co-founder- scaling to 9 full-time employees at peak capacity. We structured a solid governance framework, laying the foundation for a company that would disrupt the emerging markets and accelerate the energy transition.\n                With a clear product vision, I led the design and engineering of our digital investment platform, turning a concept into a fully operational marketplace after 10 man-years of development executed with an outsourced engineering team from NYC and Kiev.\n                To scale further, I spearheaded investor outreach and successfully raised angel and pre-seed funding, totaling $300k, ensuring growth through market fluctuations.\n                We were bootstrapped, ran lean start-up principles, and launched an aggressive go-to-market strategy, acquiring 750 companies and 2,000+ users across 36 countries within a year, positioning Positive Energy as a leader in Asia-Pacific’s sustainable finance sector.\n                Commercial traction followed thanks to our business development team located in India and Vietnam. Through strategic business development, we unlocked $1.2 billion in potential project financing, securing six term sheets for our customers and generating $100K in revenue within 12 months from those. \n                Covid almost killed the company that was then unable to raise a proper seedround and didn't benefit from public support. After relocating to Europe (Amsterdam) and to relaunch the business not only in Asia but also in Europe, I co-developed GreenEU, a €175M impact investment fund, forging a joint venture with European asset managers to accelerate the energy transition while supporting SMEs. During two years I worked with this asset management company to design the investment thesis, the impact analysis framework, and the fund's operations and key documents.\n                Our efforts did not go unnoticed. We gained global recognition, winning awards and pitch competitions from the World Bank, Schneider Electric, Siemens, and Atos. We joined the largest start-up accelerator in Hong-Kong.\n                From a bold idea to a recognized industry force, this journey has reinforced my passion for building scalable, impact-driven businesses that bridge finance and technology.\n            \n            \n                Founder & Managing Director - Future Economy Studio Pte Ltd.\n                March 2017 - December 2022: A Launchpad for Disruptive Ventures.\n                Based on my past experiences in intrapreneurship in large corporations, I created The Future Economy Studio while in Singapore as a startup studio designed to turn cutting-edge concepts into scalable businesses. Our mission: leverage digital technologies to reinvent industries, provide hands-on support to entrepreneurs, and help corporations navigate the early stages of digital transformation or venture building.\n                Within its first five months, the studio rapidly prototyped and incubated four promising ventures, each addressing distinct market needs:\n                \n                    🚀 Interactive Video Projection for Out-of-Home Advertising – A pioneering digital signage solution, transforming public spaces into interactive engagement platforms, developed by a team of 4.\n                    ⚙️ Remote Monitoring & Asset Optimization for the Cement Industry – A vibration sensor-based industrial IoT solution, designed to improve efficiency and reduce downtime, led by a team of 2.\n                    🛒 B2B E-Commerce & Outsourcing for Indirect Procurement – By negotiating a minority equity investment in Blu-Buying Singapore, we co-developed a procurement outsourcing platform, with a team of 3 driving its growth.\n                    🌱 Positive Energy Ltd.: A B2B Marketplace for Renewable Energy Financing – The studio’s most ambitious project, this fintech platform connected sustainable energy projects with investors, ultimately becoming a standalone success story.\n                \n                \n                Through a structured process of ideation, validation, and execution, The Future Economy Studio proved that speed, agility, and a bold vision can turn disruptive ideas into investable businesses. As the Future Economy Studio was bootstrapped, and I faced difficulties in finding investors for the very early stage ventures I decided to focus my energy on one single venture to maximize my chance of success. This led to the accelerated development of Positive Energy Ltd.\n            \n            \n                Head of IoT & Industry 4.0 - MANN+HUMMEL\n                March 2016 - March 2017: Driving Digital Transformation for leading automative suppliers.\n                I spearheaded the global IoT strategy, overseeing initiatives from concept to commercialization, targeting $5 million in additional revenue through new digital product lines and services.\n                To accelerate innovation, I launched and managed the IoT Innovation Lab in Singapore, assembling a multidisciplinary team of 5 experts. The lab focused on developing cutting-edge solutions for filtration and heavy equipment industries, leveraging emerging technologies to optimize operations. \n                For example we created the OurAir line of business for air quality monitoring solutions in Buildings. We also developed a 4G air filter sensors for heavy duty equipments used in Agriculture and Mining. I also developed an innovative monitoring and control solution for water treatment plants using membrane technologies.\n                I implemented a structured venture design process, applying business model canvas, service design, rapid prototyping, proof of value validation, design-to-cost optimization, and go-to-market strategies to bring IoT-enabled solutions to market.\n                Under my leadership, the team developed IoT-powered smart devices, including an air quality monitoring system and predictive maintenance solutions for industrial filtration. These innovations utilized technology like AWS IM, AWS Lambda, React, and Docker, ensuring scalable, secured, and efficient deployments.\n                I worked closely with Corporate Venture teams, scooting, evaluating and integrating start-up technologies to create synergies with MANN+HUMMEL’s product lines, enhancing both product differentiation and operational efficiency.For example, I pushed in 2016 for an early investment in Breezometer, a airquality data provider. A company acquired by Google in 2021 for $200Mln. \n                Beyond product innovation, I advised manufacturing units on IoT adoption and Industry 4.0 best practices, driving digital transformation across global operations. I also triggered the creation of a data science team to leverage inhouse data (from ERPs and other systems) to improve business decisions\n                Reporting directly to the Chief Technology Officer, I played a pivotal role in shaping the company’s digital future, managing a high-performing IoT team in Singapore and ensuring that MANN+HUMMEL remained at the forefront of smart industrial solutions.\n            \n            \n                APAC & Middle East Channel Director / Asia Commercial Director  - Schneider Electric\n                April 2013 - October 2015 | Expanding Market Reach & Driving Growth at Schneider Electric\n                 In this period, I occupied a dual role as APAC & Middle East Channel Director and Commercial Director. I led the channel strategy for a €1.4B Building Automation & Power Systems business unit, I spearheaded initiatives that supported €200M in revenue across Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. I successfully implemented the EcoExperts program, a strategic new initiative that enhanced partner performance through targeted incentives, training programs, performances review, increasing engagement across system integrators in the region.\n                To strengthen Schneider Electric’s presence, I orchestrated the region’s first multi-specialty partner event, attracting 100+ companies and fostering collaborations that led to greater channel efficiency and sales growth. I developed and launched innovative channel marketing and sales support programs (as the first youtube product tutorial of the group), significantly improving sales cycle times by 30% and increasing partner satisfaction.\n                Managing a distributed team across APAC-MENA, I directly led as part of this role two regional managers in India and Hong-Kong and indirectly eight country level channel managers, ensuring a cohesive and high-performance sales strategy.\n                In parallel, I held the role of Commercial Director for one a line of business, managing a €25M P&L and delivering a remarkable turnaround from -15% to +15% YoY growth, while sustaining gross margins above 50%. I oversaw sales and operational marketing for Light and Room Control solutions, ensuring product strategies aligned with the unique needs of markets in the region. I negotiated targets, agreed on resources allocation, and key initiatives with the countries' Business VPs while ensuring alignement with the product roadmap of the Line of Business.\n                I led strategic partnerships with local telecom and electric utility providers (HK, SG), introducing connected smart home and HVAC control solutions into key Asian markets, accelerating adoption and market penetration.By championing business model simulations and venture design workshops, I refined partnership viability and optimized go-to-market strategies, securing a competitive edge for Schneider Electric’s innovations.\n                With a team of 5 direct reports (regional application/support engineers, logistic coordinator, launch leaders) and 80 indirect sales professionals across Asia, I successfully scaled operations, strengthened partnerships, and positioned Schneider Electric as a leader in smart home and building automation solutions.\n            \n            \n                Project Director - Schneider Electric\n                April 2009 - April 2013: Pioneering Smart Home Innovation at Schneider Electric\n                The prototype and business concept convinced the group's executive team. Our Smart Home project became then one of the 5 internal start-ups of the group, a global cross business units initiative, and a strategic project for the future of Schneider Electric. \n                As part of the leadership team for Connected Home team and member of the mgnt team of the line of business in charge of the core system of the solution, I then co-led the development of this residential solutions for the US, EU, and AUS markets, backed by a €50M investment. I spearheaded the launch of Wiser, a next-gen energy management smart home solution, managing a cross-functional senior team and a €5M annual budget from prototyping to commercial launch.\n                I led the development of a brand-new residential tech platform, integrating Zigbee Energy Box, M2M (machine-to-machine) communication, cloud, web, and mobile applications, ensuring seamless connectivity and automation. This brand new architecture required the integration of multiple components sourced (message broker, cloud infra, energy box) or developed in house (application firmware/sofwtare). Most of the production was located in low cost countries (China for HW manufacturing, India for IT services) to ensure proper margins.\n                I played a critical role in releasing the first Demand Side Management API for utilities (ENGIE, GRDF), directly contributing to France’s Greenlys Smart Grid demonstrator, a pioneering project in energy efficiency.\n                By guiding cross-functional teams on customer journey design, I ensured that user experience, performance, and system efficiency were aligned with market expectations. Fun fact, I hired the first full time UI/UX designer of the group, released the first commercial zigbee HA solutions, released the first IoT connectivity relying on message brokers.\n                Managing a global team of 6 across France, Denmark, and India, and indirectly overseeing 20+ additional professionals, I was responsible for delivering a high-quality, cost-effective smart home solution that reinforced Schneider Electric’s leadership in home automation and energy management.\n            \n            \n                Project Development Manager - Schneider Electric\n                January 2008 - Jan 2009: Principal Engineer for the development of an new connected home energy management system\n                EDF was looking for a industrial partner to developed a new connected solutions for its residential customers to help them save energy while providing various demande services for EDF. Schneider Electric was interested. After few months of development, EDF decided to stop this development.
