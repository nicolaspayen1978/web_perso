  <h1>Digital Enabled GreenFund Strategic Memo</h1>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Nicolas Payen<br>
     <strong>Date:</strong> April 2025</p>
  <section id="Memo">
    <section>
      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>The design of the  Green EU Fund, originally launched to address the "Double Missing Middle" in SME climate financing, remains a unique and timely initiative. While the original team is no longer in place, the platform and operational know-how developed by GreenEU continue to offer substantial value. This memo proposes integrating GreenFundEU into Luxcara’s impact strategy or Foundation structure, aligning mission-driven financing with institutional capability.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>I’m Nicolas Payen, a founder and strategist in the climate finance space. In 2017, I launched Positive Energy Ltd (PEL), a Dutch-based climate fintech company focused on digitizing the origination and assessment of decentralized clean energy infrastructure projects. The aim was to streamline how early-stage, SME-led energy projects across Europe could access financing by making deal sourcing, ESG scoring, and impact monitoring digital, data-driven, and EU Taxonomy aligned.</p>

        <p>To complement this vision, GreenFundEU was designed in collaboration with a Belgium microfinance fund manager, as an impact-first investment vehicle supporting these underfunded projects. It aimed to fill the “Double Missing Middle”: the funding gap facing SMEs and their underrepresentation in the energy transition. While GreenFundEU never scaled into a fully active fund and is no longer operationally staffed, the platform, ecosystem logic, and digital tooling it developed remain fully functional and forward-thinking.</p>

        <p>With Luxcara’s leadership in sustainable infrastructure and Article 9 strategies, I believe there is a clear opportunity to integrate these assets into your broader ESG, innovation, or foundation strategy—without the need to restart the fund, but with a vision to seed and support it under new terms.</p>

      <h2>Strategic Integration Proposal</h2>
      <h3>Why GreenFundEU Still Matters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Targets underserved SME segment</li>
        <li>EU Taxonomy aligned</li>
        <li>Enables inclusive climate action</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What the Platform Brings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Digital origination platform developed by Positive Energy Ltd</li>
        <li>Pipeline of early-stage clean energy projects</li>
        <li>Operational playbooks and ESG tagging capabilities</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What Luxcara Can Bring</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Executional strength and track record</li>
        <li>Institutional credibility and scale</li>
        <li>Foundation or Article 9 integration</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Tiered Innovation Strategy</h2>
      <p>GreenFundEU can serve as a sandbox for ESG and digital innovation, enabling Luxcara to test and integrate smart tools for project sourcing, ESG scoring, and impact monitoring. The goal is not to restart the fund, but to seed it under the right strategic umbrella and governance model, while ensuring the platform’s integration and operational uptake.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Role and Expectations</h2>
      <p>My goal is not to manage the fund but to support its vision, ensure strategic alignment, and enable real uptake of the platform. For that, a minimum level of influence over platform implementation and fund operations would be essential to deliver its full potential.</p>

      <p><strong>Positive Energy Ltd (PEL):</strong> Dutch-based climate fintech founded in 2017. Built a digital platform for clean energy origination and ESG-aligned due diligence.</p>
      <p><strong>GreenFundEU:</strong> An impact-first fund developed to support small and mid-size clean infrastructure projects across Europe. No longer active operationally but retains platform and strategic alignment.</p>
